# Functions are defined inside blueprints to keep this file focused on app wiring.

# NOTE: To avoid excessive Airtable API calls and rate limiting, only call all_third_places
# in this get_all_third_places activity. Do NOT call all_third_places in per-place activities
# such as enrich_single_place or get_place_data. Always pass the required place data from the orchestrator.
# get_all_third_places is provided by the airtable blueprint

# Create the shared Durable Functions app

# Import blueprints to register their functions with the app
from blueprints.admin import bp as admin_bp
