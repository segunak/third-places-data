# Blueprint package for Azure Functions v2 app.
# This __init__.py marks the 'blueprints' directory as a Python package so it can be imported
# (e.g., from blueprints.admin import bp). Modules here may register functions on import.
# Keep this file lightweight and free of side effects. Its presence alone is enough for imports
# and tooling. Only add code here for package-level setup or to re-export symbols; otherwise,
# leave it empty.
