# Third Places Data

Third Places Data is a collection of data operations used to aggregate information about local third places—cafes, coffee shops, libraries, and more—into a single platform. This repository abstracts the data-fetching and transformation logic so it can be reused for various city-based third place directories, not just Charlotte.
