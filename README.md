# Third Places Data

Third Places Data is a collection of data operations used to aggregate information about local third places—cafes, coffee shops, libraries, and more—into a single platform. This repository abstracts the data-fetching and transformation logic so it can be reused for various city-based third place directories.

It was branched from [Charlotte Third Places](https://github.com/segunak/charlotte-third-places/) after I realized it doesn't need to be coupled with the front end of that website.
