## Architecture Overview

```txt
Airtable (curated data) + Google Places API (rich data) → PostgreSQL + pgvector → AI Chatbot
```

**Data Priority**: Airtable fields are authoritative for core place information (name, address, description). Google Places JSON provides supplementary data (reviews, hours, ratings, photos).

## Core Dependencies

- **PostgreSQL 15+** - Our main database with special extensions:
  - `vector` - Adds support for storing and searching "embeddings" (explained below)
  - `pg_trgm` - Handles typo-tolerant search (like autocorrect for database queries)
  - `btree_gin` - Combines different index types for better performance
- **Supabase** - A service that hosts PostgreSQL and gives you instant REST APIs
- **AI Embedding Service** - A third-party service (like OpenAI, Cohere, or others) that converts text into mathematical representations called "embeddings"

### What Are "Embeddings"? (Also Called "Vectors")

> **Key Terminology**: "Embeddings," "vectors," and "embeddings vectors" all refer to the same thing - a list of numbers that represents meaning. AI researchers say "embeddings," mathematicians say "vectors," and database people often say both. They're completely interchangeable terms.

#### The Fundamental Problem with Traditional Search

**The Problem**: Computers can't understand meaning - they only see exact letter matches. If someone searches for "cozy coffee shop" but reviews say "comfortable atmosphere," traditional databases find nothing because the words don't match exactly.

**Why This Matters**: Traditional keyword search misses 70-80% of relevant results because people describe the same concepts using different words.

#### The AI Solution: Converting Meaning into Numbers

**The Breakthrough**: AI models can read text and convert it into a list of numbers (called an "embedding" or "vector") that mathematically represents the meaning. Similar meanings get similar numbers, different meanings get different numbers.

**Real Example**:

- "cozy coffee shop" → `[0.2, -0.1, 0.8, ...]` (1,536 numbers total)
- "comfortable cafe" → `[0.19, -0.09, 0.79, ...]` (very similar numbers = similar meaning!)
- "loud nightclub" → `[-0.4, 0.6, -0.2, ...]` (very different numbers = different meaning)

#### Understanding the Technical Details

**Why 1,536 Numbers?**: This is the current standard output size for OpenAI's embedding models (specifically `text-embedding-ada-002`). Think of it like having 1,536 different "meaning detectors":

- Some numbers detect formality vs. casualness
- Others detect emotions (positive/negative)
- Others detect location types (indoor/outdoor)
- Others detect activities (study/social/dining)

**How You Actually Get Embeddings**:

1. Send text to an AI service's API: `"This coffee shop has a cozy atmosphere"`
2. The AI returns 1,536 numbers: `[0.2, -0.1, 0.8, 0.3, ...]`
3. Store those numbers in your database as a `VECTOR(1536)` column
4. Later, find similar meanings by comparing number patterns using mathematical distance

**Terminology Throughout This Document**:

- When we say **"embedding"** → we emphasize what it represents (semantic meaning)
- When we say **"vector"** → we emphasize the data structure (list of numbers)
- When we say **"embedding vector"** → we're being explicit that they're the same thing
- In SQL code: `VECTOR(1536)` is the PostgreSQL data type for storing embeddings
- In search queries: "vector similarity" = "embedding similarity" = finding similar meanings

## Schema Design Principles

### 1. AI-First Architecture

- **Vector embeddings** - Mathematical representations of text meaning that enable "smart search"
- **JSONB storage** - Flexible JSON storage that keeps Google Places data intact without forcing it into rigid table columns
- **Full-text search** - Traditional keyword search with smart features (handles typos, word variations)
- **Review chunking** - Breaking long reviews into smaller pieces so AI can quote specific parts (called "RAG" - Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### 2. Performance Optimization

- **Specialized indexes** - Different types of "lookup tables" that make different kinds of searches fast (IVFFLAT for similarity, GIN for arrays and text, BTREE for exact matches)
- **Materialized views** - Pre-calculated query results stored like cached tables
- **Automatic triggers** - Database functions that run automatically to keep search indexes updated

### 3. Data Source Hierarchy

- **Airtable data** is authoritative for core fields (name, address, website, description)
- **Google Places data** supplements with real-time info (hours, reviews, ratings)
- **Clear separation** prevents AI confusion between data sources

## Database Tables

### `places` Table

Primary entity representing a single third place venue.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- `google_maps_place_id` as PRIMARY KEY (stable Google identifier)
- `enriched_data JSONB` stores complete Google Places API responses
- `embedding VECTOR(1536)` stores OpenAI-compatible embeddings
- `reviews_tsv TSVECTOR` provides fast full-text search across all reviews

**Core Fields:**

```sql
google_maps_place_id    TEXT PRIMARY KEY    -- Stable Google identifier
airtable_record_id      TEXT NOT NULL       -- Link to Airtable identifier
place_name              TEXT NOT NULL       -- Authoritative name (Airtable)
latitude, longitude     DOUBLE PRECISION    -- GPS coordinates
address                 TEXT                -- Authoritative address (Airtable)
neighborhood            TEXT                -- Charlotte area designation
```

**Categorization:**

```sql
type                    TEXT[]              -- ["Coffee Shop", "Bookstore", ...]
tags                    TEXT[]              -- ["Industrial Chic", "Quiet", "Good Outlet Access", ...]
size                    size_enum           -- Small/Medium/Large/Unsure
parking                 TEXT[]              -- ["Free", "Street", "Paid", ...]
```

**Amenities (ENUM-constrained):**

```sql
free_wi_fi              yes_no_unsure
purchase_required       yes_no_unsure  
has_cinnamon_rolls      yes_no_sometimes_unsure  -- Extended enum for seasonal items
operational             yes_no_unsure
```

**AI/Search Fields** (The "Smart Search" Magic):

```sql
enriched_data           JSONB               -- Complete Google Places API response (stored as flexible JSON)
reviews_tsv             TSVECTOR            -- Auto-maintained search index for finding specific words in reviews
embedding               VECTOR(1536)        -- The 1,536 numbers that represent this place's "meaning" for AI similarity search
```

### `review_chunks` Table

**What This Table Does**: Breaks long customer reviews into small 2-3 sentence pieces so our AI chatbot can quote specific parts instead of giving vague summaries.

**Why We Need This**: Instead of the AI saying "reviews mention it's quiet," it can say "One customer noted: 'Perfect quiet corner for laptop work, minimal distractions.'" - giving users the exact quote and context.

```sql
review_chunk_id         BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY
google_maps_place_id    TEXT REFERENCES places
review_id               TEXT                -- Original Google review ID (so we know where it came from)
chunk_index             INT                 -- Position within original review (chunk 1, 2, 3, etc.)
chunk_text              TEXT                -- The actual 2-3 sentence piece of the review
chunk_tsv               TSVECTOR            -- Search index for finding keywords in this chunk
chunk_embedding         VECTOR(1536)        -- The 1,536 "meaning numbers" for this specific chunk
```

**Real Example**: A 500-word review gets split into 8 chunks. When someone asks about "noise levels," we can return chunk #3 that specifically mentions "surprisingly quiet despite being downtown" rather than the whole review.

## AI & Vector Search Implementation

**If You're New to AI**: This section explains how we make search "smart" - understanding meaning instead of just matching exact words. Don't worry if terms like "embeddings" or "vectors" are new - we'll explain everything step by step.

### Understanding Embeddings (The Foundation of Modern AI Search)

**The Big Picture**: Traditional databases can only find exact text matches. If someone searches for "cozy coffee shop" but reviews say "comfortable atmosphere," traditional search finds nothing. Embeddings solve this by understanding *meaning*.

**What Embeddings Actually Are**:

Think of embeddings as a "meaning fingerprint" for text. Every piece of text (a review, description, search query) gets converted into a list of 1,536 numbers that capture its semantic meaning. Similar concepts have similar numbers.

**Real Example**:

```txt
"cozy atmosphere"     → [0.2, -0.1, 0.8, 0.3, ...]
"comfortable vibe"    → [0.19, -0.09, 0.79, 0.31, ...] (very similar!)
"loud and chaotic"    → [-0.4, 0.6, -0.2, -0.8, ...] (very different!)
```

**How This Helps Users**: A search for "quiet study spot" will find places described as "peaceful reading corner" or "calm workspace" even though the exact words don't match.

**The Technology Behind This**: We use AI models (like OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`) that were trained by reading millions of books, articles, and websites. They learned to understand language so well that they can convert any text into these "meaning numbers."

**Getting Embeddings in Practice**:

1. You send text to an AI service's API: `"This coffee shop has a cozy atmosphere"`
2. The AI returns 1,536 numbers: `[0.2, -0.1, 0.8, 0.3, ...]`
3. You store those numbers in your database
4. Later, you can find similar meanings by comparing number patterns

**Why This Revolutionized Search**: Before embeddings, search engines could only find exact word matches. Now they can understand that "comfortable cafe" and "cozy coffee shop" mean similar things, even with completely different words.

### Vector Similarity Search (How We Find "Similar Meanings")

> **Vocabulary Alert**: "Vector similarity search," "semantic search," "embedding search," and "AI search" all mean the same thing - finding data that has similar *meaning* rather than exact word matches.

#### What "Vector" Means in Simple Terms

**Vector** = A fancy mathematical word for "a list of numbers." That's it! When we say "vector similarity search," we mean "find lists of numbers that are similar to my search's list of numbers."

**Why We Use Mathematical Distance**: Just like you can measure the physical distance between two addresses, you can measure the "meaning distance" between two embeddings. Similar meanings have small distances, different meanings have large distances.

#### How Vector Similarity Search Works (Step by Step)

**Step 1 - Convert Your Search to Numbers**:

```sql
-- Your search: "quiet study spot"
-- Gets converted to: [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, 0.8, ...] (1,536 numbers)
```

**Step 2 - Compare Against All Places**:

```sql
-- Find places semantically similar to a concept
SELECT place_name, neighborhood,
       embedding <-> get_embedding('quiet study spot')::vector as meaning_distance
FROM places 
ORDER BY meaning_distance  -- Closest meaning first
LIMIT 5;
```

**Step 3 - Mathematical Magic**:
The `<->` operator calculates "distance" between embeddings in 1,536-dimensional space. Think of it like GPS coordinates, but for concepts instead of locations:

- Distance 0.1 = Very similar meaning
- Distance 0.5 = Somewhat similar meaning  
- Distance 0.9 = Very different meaning

#### What This Looks Like to Your Users

**Traditional Keyword Search** (only finds exact words):

- Search: "quiet study spot"
- Finds: Places with reviews containing exactly "quiet," "study," or "spot"
- Misses: "peaceful reading corner," "calm workspace," "silent library atmosphere"

**Vector Similarity Search** (finds similar meanings):

- Search: "quiet study spot"
- Finds: Places described as "peaceful reading corner," "calm workspace," "silent library atmosphere"
- Works even though the exact words don't match!

#### Database Performance Note

**The Distance Operator**: `<->` calculates "L2 distance" (Euclidean distance) between vectors. This is the same math used to calculate the distance between two points on a map, just in 1,536 dimensions instead of 2.

**Why This is Computationally Expensive**: Without special indexes, PostgreSQL would calculate the distance from your search vector to every single place's embedding vector. For 10,000 places, that's 10,000 distance calculations per search!

### IVFFLAT Index Strategy (Making Vector Search Lightning Fast)

> **Index Types Recap**: An "index" is like the index in the back of a textbook - it helps you jump directly to relevant information instead of reading every page. Different types of data need different types of indexes.

#### Breaking Down the Acronym (Don't Memorize This!)

**IVFFLAT** = "Inverted File with Flat quantizer"

**In Plain English**: Think of IVFFLAT as "smart neighborhood grouping for super-fast search." You don't need to understand the technical terms - just know it makes vector search 10-100x faster.

#### The Performance Problem We're Solving

**Without IVFFLAT Index** (slow):

```txt
User searches for "quiet study spot"
→ PostgreSQL converts search to embedding: [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ...]  
→ Database calculates distance to ALL 10,000 places: 10,000 calculations
→ Sorts results by distance
→ Takes 2-5 seconds (unacceptably slow)
```

**With IVFFLAT Index** (fast):

```txt
User searches for "quiet study spot"  
→ PostgreSQL converts search to embedding: [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ...]
→ Index says "check neighborhoods 7, 23, and 45" (only 300 places)
→ Database calculates distance to 300 places instead of 10,000
→ Returns results in 50-200ms (blazing fast!)
```

#### How IVFFLAT Creates "Neighborhoods" of Similar Embeddings

**The Concept**: During index creation, IVFFLAT analyzes all your embeddings and groups similar ones into "neighborhoods" (called "clusters" in technical terms). When you search, it only checks the most relevant neighborhoods.

**Real-World Analogy**: Instead of visiting every house in the city to find coffee shops, you only visit the "restaurant districts" where coffee shops are likely to be.

**The SQL Implementation**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_places_embedding 
    ON places USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

**Decoding This SQL**:

- `lists = 100` = Create 100 "neighborhoods" of similar embeddings
- `vector_l2_ops` = Use L2 distance (same as `<->` operator)
- `ivfflat` = The specific type of vector index optimized for this use case

#### The Performance Trade-off (Important to Understand)

**What You Gain**:

- ✅ **Speed**: 10-100x faster searches
- ✅ **Scalability**: Performance stays good as data grows
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Still finds 95%+ of truly relevant results

**What You Give Up**:

- ❌ **Perfect accuracy**: Might miss 5% of edge cases
- ❌ **Build time**: Index creation takes longer than simple indexes
- ❌ **Memory usage**: Uses more RAM than basic indexes

**Why This Trade-off Makes Sense**: 95% accuracy in 50ms is infinitely better than 100% accuracy in 5 seconds. Users won't wait 5 seconds.

#### Tuning Guidelines (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Choose `lists` parameter based on your data size**:

- **Small datasets** (< 1,000 places): `lists = 10-50`
- **Medium datasets** (1,000-100,000): `lists = 100-1000`  
- **Large datasets** (100,000+): `lists = rows/1000`

**Rule of Thumb**: More lists = more accuracy but slower index builds and more memory usage.

#### Advanced Performance Notes

**Index Build Strategy**: IVFFLAT requires a full table scan during creation. For large datasets, build indexes during off-peak hours.

**Memory Considerations**: Each list uses additional memory. Monitor your PostgreSQL memory usage when using high list counts.

**Query Planning**: You can force PostgreSQL to use the vector index during testing with `SET enable_seqscan = off;`

### Full-Text Search (TSVECTOR) - The "Classic" Smart Search

**What This Solves**: Traditional SQL `LIKE '%coffee%'` searches are primitive. Full-text search understands language better.

**Key Features PostgreSQL Gives Us**:

- **Stemming**: "working" matches "work", "works", "worker" automatically
- **Stop word removal**: Ignores "the", "and", "is" (they don't add meaning)
- **Ranking**: More relevant matches score higher (like Google search results)
- **Boolean queries**: `'coffee & wifi & !loud'` (must have coffee AND wifi, NOT loud)

```sql
-- Search across all reviews for specific terms
SELECT place_name, ts_rank(reviews_tsv, query) as relevance
FROM places, plainto_tsquery('english', 'quiet laptop work') query
WHERE reviews_tsv @@ query
ORDER BY relevance DESC;
```

**When to Use This vs Vector Search**:

- **Full-text search**: When users search for specific features ("wifi", "parking", "outdoor seating")
- **Vector search**: When users describe a vibe or feeling ("cozy study spot", "energetic atmosphere")

**Historical Context**: Full-text search has been around since the 1990s, while vector search only became practical around 2017-2020 with transformer models like BERT and GPT. [Learn more about PostgreSQL text search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html).

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - Making AI Quote Real Sources

> **Critical AI Concept**: RAG is the difference between an AI that makes things up vs. an AI that quotes real information from your database. This is essential for trustworthy AI applications.

#### What "RAG" Stands For (Each Word Matters)

- **Retrieval** = Finding relevant information from your database first
- **Augmented** = Enhanced or improved (the AI's response is improved by real data)
- **Generation** = AI creating a natural language response

**The Complete Process**: AI retrieves → AI reads → AI generates response based on what it found

#### The Problem RAG Solves: AI "Hallucinations"

**Without RAG** (AI makes things up):

```txt
User: "Are there quiet coffee shops in South End?"
AI: "Yes! Blue Mountain Coffee on Park Road is very quiet and popular with students."
Reality: Blue Mountain Coffee doesn't exist - the AI invented it
```

**With RAG** (AI quotes real data):

```txt
User: "Are there quiet coffee shops in South End?"
AI: "Based on customer reviews, Common Market in South End is described as 'perfect for laptop work with minimal background noise' and customers note it's 'great for studying, never too crowded.'"
Reality: These are real quotes from real customer reviews in your database
```

#### Why We "Chunk" Reviews (Breaking Big Text into Small Pieces)

**The Problem with Whole Reviews**: A typical Google review might be 200-500 words covering multiple topics - noise level, food quality, wifi, parking, atmosphere, staff friendliness, etc.

**What Chunking Does**: We break each review into 2-3 sentence pieces, each focused on one specific aspect.

**Example Review Chunking**:

```txt
Original 500-word review: "I love this coffee shop! The atmosphere is cozy and perfect for studying. The wifi is super fast and reliable. However, the music can be a bit loud sometimes. The coffee is excellent, especially their lattes. Parking is easy to find on weekends but challenging during weekdays..."

Chunk 1: "I love this coffee shop! The atmosphere is cozy and perfect for studying."
Chunk 2: "The wifi is super fast and reliable."  
Chunk 3: "However, the music can be a bit loud sometimes."
Chunk 4: "The coffee is excellent, especially their lattes."
Chunk 5: "Parking is easy to find on weekends but challenging during weekdays..."
```

**Why This Helps AI**: When someone asks about noise levels, we can return Chunk 3 specifically, giving the AI the exact relevant information instead of a long review about everything.

#### The Complete RAG Process (Step by Step)

**Step 1 - User Asks a Question**:

```txt
"Are there quiet coffee shops in South End with good wifi?"
```

**Step 2 - Database Searches for Relevant Chunks**:

```sql
-- Find review chunks about noise AND wifi in South End
SELECT place_name, chunk_text, chunk_index
FROM mv_place_review_chunks 
WHERE chunk_tsv @@ plainto_tsquery('quiet OR noise OR wifi')
  AND neighborhood = 'South End'
ORDER BY ts_rank(chunk_tsv, plainto_tsquery('quiet OR noise OR wifi')) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Step 3 - AI Reads the Retrieved Chunks**:

```txt
Chunk from Common Market: "Perfect for laptop work with minimal background noise"
Chunk from Amélie's: "Reliable wifi and quiet corners for studying"  
Chunk from Not Just Coffee: "Can get noisy during lunch rush but wifi is excellent"
```

**Step 4 - AI Generates Response with Citations**:

```txt
"Based on customer reviews, here are quiet South End coffee shops with good wifi:

• Common Market is described as 'perfect for laptop work with minimal background noise'
• Amélie's has 'reliable wifi and quiet corners for studying'  
• Not Just Coffee has 'excellent wifi' though one reviewer noted it 'can get noisy during lunch rush'

All quotes are from actual customer reviews."
```

#### Technical Implementation in Our Database

**The `review_chunks` Table Structure**:

```sql
review_chunk_id         BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY
google_maps_place_id    TEXT REFERENCES places  -- Links chunk back to place
review_id               TEXT                    -- Original Google review ID
chunk_index             INT                     -- Position within original review
chunk_text              TEXT                    -- The 2-3 sentence piece
chunk_tsv               TSVECTOR               -- Full-text search index
chunk_embedding         VECTOR(1536)           -- Semantic search capability
```

**Dual Search Capability**: Each chunk can be found both by:

- **Keywords** using `chunk_tsv` (traditional search): "wifi", "quiet", "noise"
- **Meaning** using `chunk_embedding` (semantic search): "good for studying", "peaceful atmosphere"

#### Historical Context and Industry Adoption

**Timeline**:

- **2017-2019**: Large language models could generate text but often hallucinated facts
- **2020-2021**: Researchers developed RAG to ground AI responses in real data  
- **2022-2024**: RAG became industry standard for trustworthy AI applications
- **2024+**: Every serious AI application uses some form of RAG

**Why RAG Became Essential**: As AI models got better at generating convincing text, the hallucination problem became more dangerous. RAG ensures AI responses are grounded in verifiable data.

## Index Strategy (Making Everything Lightning Fast)

> **Foundation Concept**: Database indexes are like the index in the back of a textbook. Instead of reading every page to find "coffee," you flip to the index, see it's on pages 15, 47, and 203, then jump directly there. Database indexes work the same way for data.

### Understanding Database Indexes for AI Applications

#### What Database Indexes Actually Do

**Without Indexes** (slow - called a "table scan"):

```sql
-- Finding coffee shops without an index
-- PostgreSQL reads EVERY row, checking each one:
Row 1: "Italian Restaurant" - not a match, keep looking...
Row 2: "Coffee Shop" - match! But keep checking all remaining rows...
Row 3: "Bookstore" - not a match, keep looking...
...continue for all 10,000 places
```

**With Indexes** (fast - called an "index lookup"):

```sql
-- PostgreSQL checks the index first:
Index says: "Coffee shops are in rows 2, 847, 1,203, 5,891, 9,102"
-- Jumps directly to those 5 rows, ignoring the other 9,995 rows
```

#### Why AI Search Needs Special Index Types

**Traditional Database Indexes (BTREE)** work great for:

- Exact matches: `WHERE id = 123`
- Range queries: `WHERE rating >= 4`
- Sorting: `ORDER BY created_at`

**But BTREE Indexes CAN'T Handle**:

- "Find similar meanings" (vector similarity requires IVFFLAT)
- "Search across arrays of tags" (like `["wifi", "quiet", "coffee"]` requires GIN)
- "Smart text search with typos" (fuzzy matching requires trigram indexes)

#### The Four Index Types We Use (Each Solves Different Problems)

**1. IVFFLAT** = For AI similarity search (finding similar "meaning numbers")

- **Use case**: "Find places similar to 'cozy study spot'"
- **Data type**: `VECTOR(1536)` columns (embeddings)
- **How it works**: Groups similar embeddings into neighborhoods

**2. GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)** = For arrays and advanced text search

- **Use case**: "Find places with tags containing 'wifi'" or full-text search
- **Data types**: `TEXT[]` arrays, `TSVECTOR` text search columns
- **How it works**: Creates lookup tables for every word/array element

**3. BTREE** = For exact matches and sorting (the "normal" database index)

- **Use case**: "Find place with specific ID" or "Sort by rating"
- **Data types**: Numbers, dates, simple text comparisons
- **How it works**: Organizes data in a tree structure for fast lookups

**4. Trigram (GIN-based)** = For typo-tolerant search

- **Use case**: Find "Starbucks" when user types "starbks"
- **Data types**: Text columns where users might have typos
- **How it works**: Breaks text into 3-character chunks for fuzzy matching

#### Real-World Performance Impact

##### Example: Finding Coffee Shops with Wifi

```sql
-- Without proper indexes (slow - 2-5 seconds):
SELECT * FROM places WHERE 'wifi' = ANY(tags) AND 'coffee_shop' = ANY(type);
-- PostgreSQL scans all 10,000 rows, parsing arrays in each one

-- With GIN indexes (fast - 5-50ms):  
CREATE INDEX idx_places_tags ON places USING gin (tags);
CREATE INDEX idx_places_type ON places USING gin (type);
-- Now PostgreSQL jumps directly to rows containing 'wifi' and 'coffee_shop'
```

**The Math**: 5-50ms vs 2-5 seconds = 40-1000x performance improvement!

### Vector Indexes (For AI Similarity Search)

```sql
-- Semantic similarity search
CREATE INDEX idx_places_embedding 
    ON places USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);

CREATE INDEX idx_review_chunks_embedding
    ON review_chunks USING ivfflat (chunk_embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

### Full-Text Search Indexes (GIN - Generalized Inverted Index)

**What GIN Indexes Do**: Like a book index, but for every word. GIN creates a lookup table: "wifi" → [place1, place5, place12], "quiet" → [place2, place5, place9].

**Why We Need Them**: Arrays (`TEXT[]`) and full-text search (`TSVECTOR`) can't use regular indexes. GIN indexes are specifically designed for these complex data types.

```sql
-- Fast text and array searches
CREATE INDEX idx_places_reviews_tsv ON places USING gin (reviews_tsv);
CREATE INDEX idx_places_type ON places USING gin (type);
CREATE INDEX idx_places_tags ON places USING gin (tags);
```

**Performance Impact**: Without these indexes, PostgreSQL would scan every row to find arrays containing "coffee_shop" or text containing "wifi". With GIN indexes, it's a direct lookup.

### JSONB Path Indexes (Mining Google Places Data)

**The Challenge**: Our Google Places data is stored as JSON. Without indexes, queries like "find places with 4+ star ratings" would have to parse JSON in every single row.

**The Solution**: Create indexes on specific JSON paths we query frequently.

```sql
-- Fast queries into Google Places JSON structure
CREATE INDEX idx_places_google_rating 
    ON places USING btree ((enriched_data->'details'->'raw_data'->>'rating'));
CREATE INDEX idx_places_working_hours
    ON places USING gin ((enriched_data->'details'->'raw_data'->'working_hours'));
```

**Expression Indexes Explained**: `(enriched_data->'details'->'raw_data'->>'rating')` is an "expression" - PostgreSQL evaluates this JSON path and indexes the result. Now "find 4+ star places" is as fast as `WHERE rating >= 4` on a regular column.

### Fuzzy Search (Trigrams) - Handling Typos and Partial Matches

**What Trigrams Are**: Break text into 3-character chunks. "hello" becomes "hel", "ell", "llo". When someone searches "helo" (missing 'l'), it still shares trigrams with "hello".

**Real-World Impact**: Users can find "Starbucks" by typing "starbks", "starbux", or even "star". Essential for mobile users with autocorrect issues.

```sql
-- Typo-tolerant name search
CREATE INDEX idx_places_name_trgm
    ON places USING gin (lower(place_name) gin_trgm_ops);

-- Usage: WHERE lower(place_name) % 'starbks'  -- matches "Starbucks"
```

**The `%` Operator**: PostgreSQL's similarity operator. Returns true if strings are "similar enough" based on shared trigrams. You can tune the similarity threshold with `SET pg_trgm.similarity_threshold = 0.3;` (lower = more lenient).

**Historical Note**: Trigram matching has been used in spell checkers and search engines since the 1970s. It's proven, reliable technology. [Learn more about pg_trgm](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html).

## Automatic Data Maintenance (Set It and Forget It)

### Database Triggers - Your Automatic Maintenance Crew

**What Triggers Do**: Like event listeners in your application code, but at the database level. When specific changes happen to your data, triggers automatically run functions to keep everything in sync.

**Why We Use Them**: Imagine if you had to manually rebuild search indexes every time a review was added, or remember to update timestamps on every record change. Triggers handle this automatically, making your database "self-maintaining."

### The `refresh_reviews_tsv()` Trigger - Keeping Search Current

**The Problem**: When new Google Places data arrives with fresh reviews, our full-text search index becomes stale.

**The Solution**: This trigger automatically rebuilds the search index whenever `enriched_data` changes.

```sql
-- What the trigger does automatically:
-- 1. Extracts all individual review_text fields from the JSON
-- 2. Combines them into one searchable text block  
-- 3. Converts to TSVECTOR format for fast full-text search
-- 4. Stores result in reviews_tsv column
-- Fires on INSERT/UPDATE of enriched_data
```

**Why This Matters**: Without this automation, search results would become increasingly outdated as new reviews arrived. The trigger ensures search stays current without any manual intervention.

### The `set_updated_at()` Trigger - Audit Trail Automation

**Standard Housekeeping**: Every time a place record changes, automatically stamp it with the current timestamp. Essential for debugging, caching, and API responses.

```sql
-- Updates updated_at column on any row change
-- Triggers on UPDATE of places table
```

### Views - Pre-Built Query Shortcuts

**Think of Views Like**: Saved queries with friendly names. Instead of writing complex JSON parsing every time, you call a simple view name.

### `places_enriched` View - JSON Made Simple

**The Problem**: Google Places data is stored as deep, nested JSON. Writing queries like `enriched_data->'details'->'raw_data'->>'rating'` gets tedious and error-prone.

**The Solution**: This view flattens complex JSON into simple columns.

```sql
-- Instead of this nightmare:
SELECT enriched_data->'details'->'raw_data'->>'rating' as rating
FROM places;

-- You write this:
SELECT google_rating 
FROM places_enriched;
```

**Developer Quality of Life**: This view makes your code cleaner, your queries faster (no repeated JSON parsing), and your life easier.

### `mv_place_review_chunks` - The Materialized View

**What "Materialized" Means**: Regular views are just saved queries - they run fresh every time. Materialized views actually store the results physically on disk, like a cached table.

**Why We Need It**: RAG queries need to join review chunks with place information frequently. Instead of doing this expensive join every time, we pre-compute and store the results.

```sql
-- Pre-joins review_chunks with place context for fast RAG queries
-- Materialized = stored physically for speed, not computed on-demand
-- Refresh with: REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_place_review_chunks;
```

**The Trade-off**: Materialized views are faster to query but need periodic refreshing as data changes. We update this manually or via scheduled jobs when new reviews arrive.

**Performance Impact**: RAG queries that took 500ms now take 50ms because the join is pre-computed.

## Data Overlap Management

### Authoritative Data Sources

| Field Type | Airtable (Authoritative) | Google Places (Reference) |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Identity** | `place_name`, `address` | `raw_data.name`, `raw_data.full_address` |
| **Contact** | `website` | `raw_data.site` |
| **Description** | Human-curated profile | `raw_data.description` (algorithmic) |
| **Unique to Google** | N/A | `rating`, `reviews`, `working_hours`, `popular_times` |

### Implementation Strategy

**For AI Queries**: Always use Airtable fields as primary data source. Use Google Places data for supplementary information only.

**Query Pattern**:

```sql
-- CORRECT: Use Airtable name as primary
SELECT place_name, google_rating, working_hours 
FROM places_enriched 
WHERE place_name ILIKE '%coffee%';

-- AVOID: Don't use Google name as primary source
-- SELECT google_name, google_rating...
```

## Performance Considerations

### Vector Index Maintenance

- **Build time**: IVFFLAT indexes require table scan during creation
- **Memory usage**: Higher `lists` parameter = more memory, better accuracy
- **Query planning**: Use `SET enable_seqscan = off;` to force index usage during testing

### JSONB Query Optimization

- **Path indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried JSON paths
- **Expression indexes**: For computed values like `(data->>'rating')::FLOAT`
- **GIN indexes**: For existence queries (`WHERE data ? 'reviews'`)

### Materialized View Refresh

```sql
-- Manual refresh after bulk data changes
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_place_review_chunks;

-- Automated refresh via cron or application logic
-- Schedule based on data update frequency
```

## Development Workflow

### Schema Migrations

```bash
# Apply migrations
supabase db reset

# Generate new migration
supabase db diff --file new_migration_name

# Test locally
supabase start
```

### Testing Vector Queries

```sql
-- Test embedding similarity (requires actual embeddings)
SELECT place_name, embedding <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'::vector as distance
FROM places 
ORDER BY distance 
LIMIT 5;

-- Test full-text search
SELECT place_name, ts_rank(reviews_tsv, query) as rank
FROM places, plainto_tsquery('coffee wifi quiet') query
WHERE reviews_tsv @@ query;
```

### Monitoring Performance

```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Vector index stats
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE indexname LIKE '%embedding%';
```

ALTER TABLE places ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY places_select_policy ON places FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Read-only access to review chunks
ALTER TABLE review_chunks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  
CREATE POLICY chunks_select_policy ON review_chunks FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### API Rate Limiting

Configure in Supabase dashboard:

- Anonymous requests: 100/hour
- Authenticated requests: 1000/hour
- Burst protection: 10 requests/second

## Troubleshooting

### Vector Search Issues

```sql
-- Check if embeddings exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM places WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify index is being used
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM places ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.1,0.2,...]'::vector LIMIT 5;
```

### Full-Text Search Issues

```sql
-- Check TSVECTOR content
SELECT place_name, reviews_tsv FROM places WHERE reviews_tsv IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;

-- Test query parsing
SELECT plainto_tsquery('english', 'your search terms');
```

### JSONB Path Issues

```sql
-- Verify JSON structure
SELECT jsonb_pretty(enriched_data->'details'->'raw_data') FROM places LIMIT 1;

-- Test path expressions
SELECT enriched_data->'details'->'raw_data'->>'rating' FROM places WHERE enriched_data IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;
```

## Comprehensive Glossary

> **Purpose**: This glossary defines every technical term used in this document. If you're new to AI, databases, or vector search, bookmark this section and refer back to it as needed.

### AI and Machine Learning Terms

**Embedding** / **Vector** / **Embedding Vector**
: All three terms mean exactly the same thing: a list of numbers (typically 1,536) that represents the meaning of text. Example: "cozy coffee shop" → `[0.2, -0.1, 0.8, ...]`

**Semantic Search** / **Vector Similarity Search** / **Embedding Search**
: All mean the same thing: finding data based on meaning rather than exact word matches. Powered by comparing embeddings.

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
: A technique where AI first retrieves relevant information from a database, then generates responses based on what it found. Prevents AI from making things up.

**Hallucination**
: When AI confidently states information that isn't true. RAG helps prevent this by grounding responses in real data.

**Chunking**
: Breaking large text (like long reviews) into smaller, focused pieces. Helps AI find specific information instead of getting overwhelmed by irrelevant details.

**Distance (Vector Distance)**
: A mathematical measurement of how similar two embeddings are. Small distance = similar meaning, large distance = different meaning.

**L2 Distance** / **Euclidean Distance**
: The specific mathematical formula used by the `<->` operator to calculate similarity between embeddings. Same math used to calculate the distance between points on a map.

### Database and PostgreSQL Terms

**Index**
: A database "lookup table" that helps find data quickly, like the index in the back of a book. Different types optimize for different kinds of searches.

**BTREE Index**
: The standard database index, great for exact matches and sorting. Can't handle arrays, text search, or vector similarity.

**GIN Index (Generalized Inverted Index)**
: Specialized index for arrays and text search. Creates lookup tables like "wifi" → [row1, row5, row12].

**IVFFLAT Index**
: Specialized index for vector similarity search. Groups similar embeddings into "neighborhoods" for fast searching.

**Trigram Index**
: Specialized index for typo-tolerant search. Breaks text into 3-character chunks to handle misspellings.

**Table Scan** / **Sequential Scan**
: When PostgreSQL reads every row in a table to find matches. Slow but thorough.

**Index Lookup** / **Index Scan**
: When PostgreSQL uses an index to jump directly to relevant rows. Fast and efficient.

**TSVECTOR**
: PostgreSQL's data type for full-text search. Stores preprocessed text with word positions for fast searching.

**JSONB**
: PostgreSQL's binary JSON data type. Faster than regular JSON and supports indexing on specific paths.

**Materialized View**
: A view that stores query results physically on disk for speed, rather than computing results on-demand.

**Trigger**
: A database function that runs automatically when data changes. Used for keeping search indexes up-to-date.

### Search and Query Terms

**Full-Text Search**
: Advanced text searching that understands language features like stemming (work = works = working) and stop words (ignoring "the", "and").

**Fuzzy Search** / **Typo-Tolerant Search**
: Search that finds matches even when users make spelling mistakes. "starbks" finds "Starbucks".

**Boolean Search**
: Text search using operators like AND, OR, NOT. Example: `coffee & wifi & !loud` (must have coffee AND wifi, NOT loud).

**Stemming**
: Reducing words to their root form. "working" → "work", "better" → "good". Helps find more matches.

**Stop Words**
: Common words like "the", "and", "is" that are ignored in search because they don't add meaning.

### Performance and Optimization Terms

**Query Planning**
: How PostgreSQL decides the most efficient way to execute a query, including which indexes to use.

**Expression Index**
: An index on a calculated value rather than a column. Example: indexing `(data->>'rating')::FLOAT` for fast JSON queries.

**Cardinality**
: How many unique values a column has. High cardinality = many unique values, low cardinality = few unique values.

**Selectivity**
: What percentage of rows match a query condition. High selectivity = few matches, low selectivity = many matches.

### Vector Search Technical Terms

**Dimensionality**
: How many numbers are in a vector. OpenAI embeddings are 1,536-dimensional (1,536 numbers per embedding).

**Vector Space**
: The mathematical concept of treating lists of numbers as points in multi-dimensional space. Enables distance calculations.

**Quantization**
: A compression technique that reduces vector precision to save memory. The "flat" in IVFFLAT means no quantization is used.

**Clustering**
: Grouping similar vectors together. IVFFLAT creates clusters (neighborhoods) of similar embeddings for fast search.

**ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)**
: Algorithms that find "close enough" matches very quickly, rather than perfect matches slowly. IVFFLAT is an ANN algorithm.

### API and Integration Terms

**REST API**
: A standard way for applications to request data over HTTP. Supabase automatically generates REST APIs from your database schema.

**PostgREST**
: The technology Supabase uses to automatically create REST APIs from PostgreSQL databases.

**RLS (Row Level Security)**
: PostgreSQL feature that controls which rows users can see or modify based on policies you define.

**Webhooks**
: Automatic HTTP requests sent when data changes. Useful for triggering AI processing when new reviews arrive.
