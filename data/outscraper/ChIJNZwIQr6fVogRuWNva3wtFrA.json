If you're on Providence Rd in a certain direction during rush hour traffic, it can be a little tricky getting to the library. I ended up going farther down Providence, making a u-turn, and then taking a quick left then right into the parking lot.\n\nThe women's restroom was clean. Sitting at the computer station, I could hear that the attendant near the front door was very helpful as people went to the desk to ask questions.\n\nI saw the Black History Month display, but just barely and only because I was looking for the restroom. I know that this is a smaller location, but the display should've been in a more prominent location. If you weren't coming out of a restroom or going anywhere near the room being used for a youth event, it's not easily seen at all. Hoping that wasn't done intentionally."

There are often youth activities available (coloring pages for example) as you exit. Though it doesn't open until 9 am on weekdays, there is a book return directly outside the main entrance. It is simple to reserve books online and pick-up in the library (shelves near the children's room)! Easy, private parking lot too!"

Lora did a look up and found it in a few seconds. The guy there Justin is the nicest fella you could ever meet and went and helped my kid find some other books. Then the other lady there, told me her name but I'd surely butcher it, showed me how to use the computer to find stuff and the self checker. Very polite crew you all have there. Your boss should go train the folks at Walmart on customer service."

Kids are not expected to just sit in one area but can dance and walk around the room during the story time time.\n\nOne very negative aspect would be when I witnessed a librarian asking a Mother to go take her child for a walk because the baby was crying. The mother and child were in the children's area and the baby was doing what normal babies do it. The mother was very flustered and ended up just leaving the library. Things like this I find to be unacceptable, and hopefully it is not something that happens often"
