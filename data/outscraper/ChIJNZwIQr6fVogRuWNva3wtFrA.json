If you're on Providence Rd in a certain direction during rush hour traffic, it can be a little tricky getting to the library. I ended up going farther down Providence, making a u-turn, and then taking a quick left then right into the parking lot.\n\nThe women's restroom was clean. Sitting at the computer station, I could hear that the attendant near the front door was very helpful as people went to the desk to ask questions.\n\nI saw the Black History Month display, but just barely and only because I was looking for the restroom. I know that this is a smaller location, but the display should've been in a more prominent location. If you weren't coming out of a restroom or going anywhere near the room being used for a youth event, it's not easily seen at all. Hoping that wasn't done intentionally."

There are often youth activities available (coloring pages for example) as you exit. Though it doesn't open until 9 am on weekdays, there is a book return directly outside the main entrance. It is simple to reserve books online and pick-up in the library (shelves near the children's room)! Easy, private parking lot too!"

Then the other lady there, told me her name but I'd surely butcher it, showed me how to use the computer to find stuff and the self checker. Very polite crew you all have there.
