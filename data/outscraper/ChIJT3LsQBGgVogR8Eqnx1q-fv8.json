It's more of a \"coffee bar\". Their brew is 80% consistent. Depends on who's working and if they are trying a new bean. One thing I find a bit frustrating is that they sometimes put ice inside the half and half bottle which waters it down and makes my coffee taste bland instead of creamy. Would love if they ban that practice. Otherwise, excellent coffee and friendly staff."

I loved this place, Kenya was so warm and pleasant it makes me want to go back everyday just to have her work her magic!
