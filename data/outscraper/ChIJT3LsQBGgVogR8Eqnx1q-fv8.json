It's more of a \"coffee bar\". Their brew is 80% consistent. Depends on who's working and if they are trying a new bean. One thing I find a bit frustrating is that they sometimes put ice inside the half and half bottle which waters it down and makes my coffee taste bland instead of creamy. Would love if they ban that practice. Otherwise, excellent coffee and friendly staff."

I loved this place, Kenya was so warm and pleasant it makes me want to go back everyday just to have her work her magic!

The person taking the order did not know a Cubano from an americano, but insisted they could make a flat white. The flat whites were made like lattes. The espresso for the flat whites and the straight shots tasted burnt. When Starbucks makes a better shot, you have to be doing something wrong. They also don't have whipped cream, at all. I hope this was an isolated incident, but according to my barista friend (who got the plain shot) their machine had to be way off to pull shots that bad."
