She kept asking me my number as if she couldn't hear me although I was very clear in my volume and enunciation. I love sunflower cafe's however I will not be returning to this location."

This location is great, but some of the others can be a little rude and unwelcoming.

Subsequently I received my order after ANOTHER 20 minutes and the order was arranged very sloppily and also the ingredients mashed together as if done purposely by those irresponsible employees, to signal their discontent with having to serve me. DO NOT go to this restaurant and patronize this establishment. IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!"

I really had to practice composure. It was the nasty attitude that really pissed me off and the fact that I waited extra long the first time, the order was wrong, and after waiting for them to remake it they never did. I waited for another 20 minutes for them to finally remake my order, and when I got it it was of poor quality. It seems like someone purposely crunched up the bacon in pieces.\nThat was so unnecessary. I was very upset with the service and behavior of the staff."

I went back to the counter and asked for it to be remade. After waiting another 20 mins I went to check on it and with a scathing, rude and frustrated attitude I was basically scolded and told I never asked them to remake anything. At this point I had to hold back showing my own discontent because I was never impolite, my order was small and simple, and the mistakes were at MY expense, not theirs. Anyway after ANOTHER 20 mins I finally get my stupid bacon and egg sandwich with NO cheese and it appeared slapped together. Literally. Like someone angrily smashed it or sat on it. Bacon crunched up everywhere. That was the last straw. I will NEVER be back and it would warm my heart if this helped anyone else reconsider doing ANY business here."

I told them that I would overpay in cash and that they could keep the change as a tip and they refused!!! I own two businesses and this is just disgusting behavior! I tell SO many people about this place and its just incredibly disappointing that this happened. There have also been a couple of other sketchy things that occurred with past orders/experiences there but I don't like to leave negative reviews....just can't ignore this!!"

I ate half the sandwich, stared at the 2nd half for a moment, then gave in and ate it ALL.  I went in hungry and left STUFFED!  My son ate every bite of his meal as well.  While we were there I was impressed by how hard working the staff was.  They greeted everyone with a smile (even customers who took too long to order which is totally understandable with so many options to choose from!) and made sure the tables were wiped down and the seating area was clean.  The restrooms in the back were also clean and well stocked.  Mostly I enjoyed watching so many couples and families sit down and relax in this little gem of a restaurant.  I overheard one lady tell her husband they only had 5 minutes before they had to leave but they still enjoyed the break from the normal chaos of life to sit down, sip their coffee and enjoy their pastry.  We will definitely be back to do the same."

I asked for a refund for that item the manager printed another copy of the receipt.  Not a refund. I pointed this out and she got mad. I asked for contact information for owners  (Mr Parrish) and was refused. It comes across as the kind of place that spits in the coffee of police. Simply put, health department should come in for an audit. Cleanliness was fair. Staff doesn't want to be there and the owner doesn't seem to care. The other locations might be better, but this one is horrible.  This decline has taken place over a year. It was good a year ago, then items would be missing or wrong in pick up orders,  then dirty facilities,  no napkins,  owner was reached out to through another location and no response.  If you look at recent reviews this is the trend for this location. Waffle House at 3 am is cleaner and more reliable."

I was told I could pick up my cake on Friday morning. The order was put in on Thursday morning. When I called on Friday morning I was told the cake would not be ready until Saturday morning. This was okay because the celebration was sat evening. Well I was called saturday morning to be asked what type icing I wanted on the cake. Because I was working I did not get the message until late. Well when I picked up my order it was a chocolate cake with chocolate layer icing. I was told that classic birthday cakes come chocolate made. It was not what I ordered. So my first experience ordering from this company was bad. It's also to far to drive to and not get what you ordered. I'll be sticking to what works, getting my cakes from Sam's Club."

The fact that they were out of several products when I arrived and I really wanted to taste their cinnamon rolls is the only reason I didn't give them a perfect score of five stars.

Management? Order processing? Who knows. All I know is that if you don't open up your to-go bag in the restaurant and tell them what items you are missing/were made incorrectly, right then and there, then you will get home with EVERYTHING WRONG. If you have a to-go order from here may God be with you and I hope you don't have any serious allergies."

When they rang me up, it came out to $27.07 and was shocked, but I bought it anyway so we would have it for St Pats Day. It was horrible. It was not worth anything near that price. It was hard, dry and had no flavor. Lucky they had raisins in it. That was the only taste it had, other than the butter we had to pile on. They should see what they could do to make it better, maybe go to Ireland and see how there are supposed to be made or not make them at all."

Like I can't finish what I ordered because it was so bad. All of their recipes lack salt, are dry, and so not seem fresh. Recipes you would think you can't screw up, like a muffin or cinnamon roll. Also, the table tops were sticky, which is just gross. It's sole redeemer is the croissant, hence the one star."

Both sandwiches were missing avocado, which is an extra charge, including the AVOCADO TOAST. How does that happen? Not to mention that my $10.50 croissant sandwich was so pathetic and essentially an open face sandwich with one small piece of croissant and a sad portion of egg and cheese smooshed together that I mistook for the other side of the bread. It looks like I ordered an onion and pesto sandwich. The key lime pie was sizable and good.\n\nSeems food quality and poor service are an issue at this location based on other reviews so we definitely will not be wasting money here again."

The service leaves a lot to be desired with staff that never seems happy, and wait times that are hard to justify for coffee or baked goods.\n\nThe bread used on their sandwiches is always great, but the rest usually lacks flavor and any moisture.  To ensure it's not dry, it would need mustard (a 50 cents add on), or multiple condiments... otherwise, be sure you have water on hand.  I've tried this place for years and unfortunately it has lost its local bakery neighborhood feel as the goal seems to be expansion while compromising on service and taste."

We decided to try it again this past weekend and placed an online order for 4 sandwiches. After the order was confirmed, it said it would be ready at 10:15. We arrived a few minutes late at 10:20, expecting it to be ready but it was not. I stood by the prepaid order pick up without being acknowledged for over 5 minutes while workers were just pidding around. After finally getting the attention of someone, I was told our order was not ready and it would be up next. Fast forward 15 more minutes and it was still not ready. In total, our 10:15 order wasn't ready until 10:50 which is beyond acceptable. To make things worse we got home and they were prepared incorrectly. Sadly, we will likely not be visiting this location again due to the poor service."

I so often leave empty handed or with a day old stale pastry from the back because they aren't prepared at opening."

I waited over 30 minutes for an iced mocha, people who had come in after me were getting their food before I even got my drink. My sister got her drink within 2 minutes of ordering but mine never came. When I attempted to explain this to her several times (at least 3) she kept cutting me off and asking me if I had gotten my \"latte\" which I had never ordered. But instead of waiting 5 second for me to finish my sentence she was brash, and cut me off several times like I didn't know what I was talking about. She also treated several other customers this way. Everyone else there was very kind and the girl working the drink station apologized profusely even though it wasn't her fault. But the managers attitude was very off putting and not representative of what I have come to know sunflour bakery to be. If I was rating just off her attitude it would be one star. I only added an additional one due to the kindness of the other staff members."
