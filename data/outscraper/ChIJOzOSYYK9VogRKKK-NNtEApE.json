There was only one person working, taking orders and doing the cooking so service was very slow.   There are these horrible flickering fluorescent lights. I would suggest swapping them out, it would make a huge difference. Also more art, plants, and some comfy chairs would give this place an older and more established feel. Adding darker colors would help with the ambiance too. Lastly, I didn't receive a coffee cup sleeve and since my coffee was hot I couldn't pick it up and sip it while my order was being made. This is clearly a new business, probably owner operated, I think there is great potential but definitely some improvements needed."

However, the customer service was lacking a bit. I would love to have known more about the business and their offerings, but there wasn't much interaction with the employees. The French toast muffin is incredible! It's not too sweet and tasted just like French toast. I would appreciate napkins being out for customers and maybe not use so much bleach when cleaning the floors. I wanted to dine in, but the smell was too strong. I think this place could definitely be a staple in the community."

The cleanliness was impeccable, every corner of the space was spotless, which added to the overall comfort of the experience.\n\nThe staff were professional, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. They made me feel welcome and were happy to answer my questions about the menu. The coffee was outstanding--rich, flavorful, and perfectly brewed and paired beautifully with the freshly made pastries and light bites. I also had the Philly and chicken cheese sandwiches and they were delicious with perfect serving sizes. Can't beat the pricing!\n\nIt's clear this cafe values its customers and takes pride in its service. Whether you're looking for a place to relax, work, or catch up with friends, this is the perfect spot. I'll definitely be back soon! Highly recommended."
