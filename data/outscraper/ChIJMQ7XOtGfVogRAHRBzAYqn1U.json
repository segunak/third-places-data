At home I make Vietnamese coffee (robusta in a thin + condensed milk). There was construction noise and I was craving some VN coffee...perhaps it's been altered substantially to suit an american palette, but to me, it didn't taste any different aha a regular iced coffee. It was sort of bland, IMO. It would be nice to have seen something like coconut coffee, too. My review is tainted by a recent trip to Viet Nam...but yeah. If I'm paying for coffee I expect it to be as good or better than I can make at home. On the plus side they have an absolutely exquisite selection of loose leaf teas, nice ambience, and great staff. Overall still worth patronizing :)"

I could not eat it and had to toss it out. Really disappointed with this waterbean location I would like to be a customer and continue giving them business but I just cannot with the way they have been doing things unfortunately I will not be going back.

The options are $2.35 individually, or, \"to save a few bucks,\" a box of 5 for $12.50. I'll let you use your phone calculator to figure out the savings.\nTL;DR Starbucks is 300 meters up the street.\nEDIT: Spoke to my wife, the wait was 20-25 minutes, not 15. My bad."
