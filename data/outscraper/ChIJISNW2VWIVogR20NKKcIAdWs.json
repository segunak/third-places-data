Food was despite the tomato bisque having too much pepper for my taste. Ah! But the desserts.... Worth dying for. I had to take some more to go.  Not to be boomer, but someone should make sure that the silverware is 100% clean."

What really bothered me was that the manager I'm assuming was walking around doing inventory!!!!! Not helping her staff. People were waiting FOREVER.  She had no care in the world. Didn't stop what she was doing. Just walking around with a clipboard counting things while her staff were running around. I just don't understand. We could have went to a sit down restaurant and left by the time we got our food there. Also. The food was terrible. The plain sourdough turkey sand had been cut in half and had all kinda of spread all over it from where they cut it I guess.  My son who is so picky didn't want to even eat it. Such I bad experience I will never go back. I wish i had a picture if the food we waited over 30 minutes for."

Ordered chicken sandwich and French dip. Chicken sandwich wasn't as spectacular as we expected. The French dip was was delicious. On the way out we picked up a french almond pastry for $6. It was terrible. It was hard like a 3 days old and completely dried out and inedible. Very disappointed. This place may be iconic but it has lost something along the way."

The selection of baked goods was phenomenal. It was sooo difficult to make up our minds. So we found ourselves getting several selections. Each one was well baked and delicious. The quality was excellent in it all.\nThey also have a very good tea selection and other cold and hot drinks. My hot latte was made just right.\nThis location is in an old bank and has a wonderful eclectic atmosphere of decorations and architecture. The old bank vault is very cool!\nThis will always be a stop for us whenever we are back."

Having already walked by Rock Hill coffee shop, we stopped there first and grabbed some iced coffees. Upon entering Amelie, we were greeted nicely and went to order brunch. However, as we were ordering we were told that if we wanted to drink our iced coffees we would have to eat outside. In other words, we were not allowed to eat inside this cafe (which unbeknownst to us, also serves coffee) if we wanted to continue drinking our iced coffee from the roaster right down the road. We asked them if they were sure they didn't want to take our money, and the cashier informed us that they were sorry but they didn't make the rules. Rather than be shamed into eating outside on a warm day, we took our business next door to Flipside cafe right down the road. They were great and happily welcomed us and our iced coffees."

The vanilla cream inside was very creamy and had great flavor. Their tartlets are delicious and come in many varieties, including my favorite: lemon raspberry. Their creme brulee is the best I've ever had, and the coffee is very good as well. I love the atmosphere here! Lots of beautiful paintings adorn the walls, and many decorations include repurposed materials. I HIGHLY recommend eating here if you are coming to Rock Hill. I will certainly be back soon!"

Chicken salad sandwiches have never been found in France, the croissant maybe. The French pastries were beautiful. We bought $65.00 worth to bring home and share with the family. The macarons tasted flavorless peaches and cream tasted nothing like a peach. Chocolate salted caramel was not sifted when made so there were large blobs of flour and chocolate no caramel or salt. The key lime pie was not fresh and the cream was past its prime. The chocolate cake was stale it was so dry you could hit the side with a fork and not make a dent in the cake. If you have nothing to compare your food to you might enjoy but, if you've ever lived in Paris do not expect the level of excellence that comes from the French Bakeries in France."

They had a Mother's Day Gift Box special written for $25 on a tiny board on top of the display of sweets. I was in a rush and when checking out I noticed the price was $30.50. When I asked about it I didn't get straight answer. Then taxes were $2.60 which made my total $33.10. Who I think to be the manager gave me an attitude when I asked her about the price. I absolutely love their food, and that's why my review is not 1 star, but I did not have a pleasant visit today and it made me not want to go back."

            "review_text": "Updating from 2* to 1*. It's been 5 months and no one cared do respond.\nI love the original Amelie's in NoDA, Charlotte, the downtown one and the Pineville location but this Rock Hill one was a disappointment. The art and location are amazing, the building is the best out of all of them. Beautiful light, bright warm eclectic place, does not disappoint.\nBut, the service was halfway decent. I was really surprised. The young kids were super nice but many of them were just standing around socializing. They got my tea order wrong, couldn't tell me what was inside the herbal tea, they just names the color. I asked if they have lavender, they didn't tell me it was about 75% chamomile and only part lavender. Loved the tea! But, I had to get up and tell them that they only gave me Earl grey leaves and there were no herbs in it, they forgot to put the second bag of tea in the cup after they charged me extra for it, which they have never done before. -1 \nThey walked straight past me, as if I was not standing by the pastries waiting to be served on the 2nd time. I don't know if they just ignored me on purpose because I was taking photos of the pastries or because they were having a staff meeting with 5 young people just sitting in a circle and not paying attention. Those bring our fresh pastries didn't say anything to the group, they just all were talking about what came out of the oven. I don't know happened, it took me actually coming up to the register and trying to get someone's attention to order a second pastry to go. - 1 \nOur bigger table on the first floor was super sticky, must be because they use cleaning products on a table that should not be treated with chemicals or because they use dirty rags. That table should be taken care of, I couldn't place my hands on it or my bag. They took a while to make the food/tea. There was a ton of people working and the place was not packed after the lunch rush hour, we were there getting food after 1:30 on a Tuesday. Also, their music was too loud, it was hard to have a group conversation. And, I guess the large space does not have anything to absorb sound on the floor or walls so it was naturally louder then it could have been maybe because of the windows and all the hard surfaces. -1\nI was disappointed that the tarts had their fruits pushed to the side as if the entire tray was tilting sideways when they were made. It tasted great as usual because they use the same recipes as all the older locations but there was no finesse to it. A crooked pastry is not something ideal to serve a photographer who's trying to get a grea shot and all the fruits are pushed to the side overflowing on the tart itself.\nI was underwhelmed, it felt like an authentic, eclectic, local European bakery and deli was taken over by an American franchise with horrible training for their really young employees who didn't know how to offer good customer service skills and lacked people skills or the skills to take an order and deliver it correctly and timely, especially when they charged extra for it.\nTo the owner. I hope you read and make some improvements because all the other locations had me come regularly and enjoy the place for hours. This was my first visit. The only reason I'll go back is because no one else makes those European pastries around here correctly, or unless I have to meet someone there. I was hoping it would be my new favorite spot down here since Rock Hill doesn't have many eclectic places to offer. Unfortunately unless they improve, I won't be coming back regularly to spend time in there."

I was learning and growing, as I hoped. Then something shifted with in the managerial staff, that was unsettling. The happy, professional environment I once loved was slowly deteriorating. The new Assistant General Manager Renee, was unprofessional, hostile and combative in the work place. She often would speak poorly about other workers including myself. In addition, she would encourage a hostile catty work environment. I recently had the flu and decided it would be best to take the time off of work. After going to the doctor, I felt it would be best not to expose my coworkers. I even spoke to Amanda who advised I would be covered and report to work Monday 11/28/22. I was following the handbook and proper protocol as instructed and stayed in communication throughout the week. As I returned to work Monday 11/28, I was able to clock in, then immediately directed by Renee to come have a private conversation. She then advises I had been terminated effective immediately. I was shocked at her demeanor as she was delivering this termination with sheer gratification. She even smirked as she delivered this news. I couldn't believe her lack of compassion or empathy as she was letting me go. I  tried to provide the doctors note to prove I wasn't in violation. But all she insisted was a point system which was never disclosed during any point of the duration of employment. I am at a loss of words, how a place which once provided me satisfaction and joy became such a dramatic, catty, unprofessional work environment. Poor management is the cause of my termination and it is truly disheartening that a company would keep such a deplorable person on their staff. I wouldn't suggest working here, as you will more than likely have the same situation occur right before the 90 day mark."

When we came out, since they told us we could not eat inside because they were about to close, but we realized we did not had any napkins. I went back and kindly knocked on the door since it was locked. My daughter which was beside me, was there watching how the 3 young ladies that were working the shift were ignoring me/us.  I stayed there and made signs for napkins, and  after a while a blonde young lady with a very bad attitude, according to her body language and the way she came to us. She brought us 5 napkins and she stated to me that if I needed more napkins I could  go around the corner to a Jimmy Johns.  I told her, that  I just came out of the Amelie's location, and spent money with them, that I am their customer and they could have been kind to me and provide good service. She tried to close the door in my face while I was talking, all this in front of my  little daughter. I said to her that this was not the way to treat clients. At the time there was a young lady with black hair working on the cashier machine, and another one just looking. I have never had an experience like this, I will  never come to this location again. Hopefully this lady wasn't being racist to us.  Staff should have a customer experience training. Experience is all in all types of industries."

The mousse was heavenly, not too sweet and melts in your mouth. The macrons are wonderful and are a perfect sweet treat. My son really enjoyed the cotton candy macron. They have a wide variety of macrons to chose from for all cravings. The coffee and hot chocolate were delicious as well. Amelie's is a gem right in the middle of downtown, you should definitely visit!"

The pastries have always been decent, but the past 2 times I got the spinach, asparagus, and leek soup it has been awful. Today the broth was oily instead of creamy and completely separated. I only had spinach in my soup as well. Not sure where the other veggies were, but I'm very disappointed for $7 a bowl. Lastly, my to-go bowl of soup was only filled up 3/4 of the way. Not like it matters since it was like drinking oil. When I've had this soup in the past from other locations, the broth is super creamy and flavorful, and it's loaded with veggies. This version of the soup was oily and beyond bland. Would not recommend this location."

I'm a French Cuisine freak, so I am highly critical of French Restaurants, Bakeries, Cafes and Bistros. You can't go wrong with Amelia's. The food is GENUINELY French and oh, so, so, good. The girls at The Rock Hill location could have been more friendly and hospitable, but perhaps they were just having one of those not so good mornings, we all have. BUT. It sure didn't come out in the food. Everything was made to perfection. If I had more time in the area, I would have been back for more. This is definitely a must go to French Bakery and Restaurant. The Croque Monsieur was great. As all of the other items I had. And you can't walk out without any kind of the bakery items or you will be missing even more good items. The pastries and the small mousse cups never made it to lunch hour. I will most definitely be back for more of Amelie's. The best way to sum it up, is I told them they needed to open one up in Chattanooga, TN, where I'm from. They really deserve more than 5 stars."

This of course is a business issue and not a customer issue however, today (after working in the coffee shop all day with no complaints) an older white woman complained to the workers that she almost tripped over my chord. Which led them to come over and ask me to unplug my set up and possibly move. My chord was not in a main walkway and there of course were many other routes to her seat however, I chose to be compliant and unplug.\n\nMy grievance with this is that this is a coffee shop and many others come here to work. Without proper outlets I cannot work. The lack of outlet and placement of outlets are NOT my problem. However, due to the complaint of one white woman I was expected to unplug and possibly relocate.\n\nMake out of this what you will but It was not a great experience for me."
