This place is probably better for just taking your drink to go, not necessarily inviting to stay/spend more.\n\nThe barista accidentally let me sit in the \"gallery\" but the receptionist who was MIA when I first came in then notified me that I couldn't sit there after popping out of the backroom and suddenly she was back at her little desk. Men's clothing looked cute but there seemed to be a meeting going on in the shop area. Kind of just a stale vibe.  The barista was very nice and pleasant."
