I had a very brief, but  unpleasant interaction with Wendy in customer service. Their kiosk seem to be down so she told me she would help me out. I immediately let her know that I like to go to the kiosk cause I get really anxious trying to pull up all the QR codes and they take forever. Her attitude change completely and got aggravated that I did not have all the QR codes pulled up at once. She was Huffing and puffing while i waited for them to load. She was very cold and unfriendly. If you're gonna be working in customer service, maybe have some customer service skills first. Wendy needs better training."

I love this time of the year when there are holiday items set up as gift ideas. The 365 products in particular are some of my favorites. We've ordered our organic turkey and we're looking for ham. So ready for the holiday season!\n\nUpdate! Tried the Bisou Sweet - a Woman owned company. I tried the Cinnamon Doughnut Muffins and OMG! Added the pic/video to my review here on Google Maps. This is my New addiction. Have it with a cup of coffee or tea. Enjoy!\n\nJosephine"

But what's available is the question. The butchery/meat area is tiny they have limited frozen meal options. But the vitamins and supplements are good selections. The cafe area is always dirty and they offer a very limited selection of food and I wouldn't call it hot food either. Room temp at best. But in all it isn't awful. Don't just take my word for it, go see for yourself and you may love it."

An employee, maybe a/the manager, came over and said to ignore the instructions and place the kiosk stickers directly on the item packaging, after waiting again in the then even lengthier line. She was very dismissive and rude, at which point I had to explain that I had kids in the car and couldn't stand in line for another 20 minutes just to re-try my returns based on faulty instructions. I like Whole Foods in general, but the management at this location could be much improved."

I'm not sure why the bakery seems to be such a miserable place to work at but the lady there was RUDE. There is an older woman in her 50s or 60s with medium length gray hair. I asked her how fresh the cakes were so I could decide on purchasing one from the display or order a custom cake. The last cake I had purchased didn't taste fresh and was dry. She says to me \"ALL of our cakes are fresh so I'm not sure what you're asking me.\" Ummm okay.. I was caught off guard by her rude tone so o explained my last experience and wanted to see when they had been made. Instead of asking me which ones I was interested in she responds with \"Well be specific because I'm not going to sit here and tell you the dates of every single one\" I point to the one I was looking at and she says \"WHICH ONE?\" I again repeat, this chocolate one and point to it. I guess she's blind because she asked a third time which one. I just looked around because I had to be on Punked or something. She finally says it was made on the 16th and is beat by the 21st which is tomorrow. So obviously NOT FRESH. She then rudely asks \"we'll do you want it\"  I say no because it's not fresh and walked away. I didn't order one because there was no way I was sitting through any more of that disrespect. I'm telling you to stay away from the bakery here. It's cursed and the employees will speak to you like they're doing you a favor when you're the customers keeping the business open and giving them a place to work!\n\nThis review is for the bakery. I called a few days before going to the store to ask if they made cakes to order. The woman on the phone told me they did so I decided to go in person to order what would have been my daughters birthday cake. once there the cake director, or whatever they call her, came up to me with a piece of paper ready to write down the order. I explained to her that I had never ordered a cake from Whole Foods. She asked me how many people the cake was for, the flavor, and the icing type. I told her when the pick up date was and that was it.. i was confused because she showed me nothing other than that piece of paper.. so I asked her if I had any say in what the cake was going to look like because she didn't show me any pictures or gave me the option of picking colors, etc.. when I asked her if I could choose any colors (my daughter is turning 4 and is particularly excited about her cake) this woman looks at me like I was crazy and shakes her head no. She was completely rude and not helpful at all.i ended up placing the order anyway despite not having a clue on how this damn cake was going to look like.. all I knew was that the cake would be red velvet, the Icing would be white apparently because you can't chose any colors, and some where it would say \"happy birthday\".. after the initial shock I realized that there was no way I was doing business with someone that rude and that unhelpful. Not to mention pay for a pricey cake that I most likely won't even be happy with. So I called and cancelled that order. Lesson learned. Never order a cake from WF unless you're into surprises. I've ordered dozens and dozens of cakes from different places and this is the first time I wasn't given options on how they would decorate the cake. Huge disappointment."

That is not what you said but ok.\n\nGo home and placed an order online without issue.\n\nCome to pickup cake ....they have a special process. Go to the special pickup (where the Amazon orders are handled) NOPE nobody there. Go to the bakery am I to pick up here? NOPE go to customer service... hi here to pickup a cake NOPE go to where the trays for catering are by the meat counter NOPE go to this person by the salad bar \"special help desk\" yes you pay here. WHAT I already paid online... oh just go over to the Bakery area. ARE YOU KIDDING!!! I started there twenty minutes ago.  Same lady at the bakery who sent me on my trails around the store.

My first thought was going to Butcher every morning for Breakfast rolls, Braunschweiger & whatever meat needed to cook Lunch/Dinner. So of course I first had to hit the Butcher Dept & was shocked @ how clean the area appeared, best of all the Steaks looked wonderful & HOW Steak should look. I wasn't there for Meats but I bought about 5 lbs of Hamburger meat & intend on going back for Steaks, Pork or \"any\" kind of Meat needed. I drove all the way there to buy Infant Formula for my Grand daughter who Loves \"Kabrita\" { German Goat Milk Formula} During the Formula Shortage I was looking on Amazon & Noticed all the German brands of Formula were not only in stock but seemed 'healthier' formularies to include the DHA/AHA. These formulas say \"Toddler\" but are most DEFINITELY for infants. Kabrita has made such a difference in her health it's unreal! We're no longer having to rely on Reflux meds for Acid Reflux & her whole Gastrointestinal is better. So HOW did \"Whole Foods\" come into the Equation? I tried ordering Kabrita on Amazon but wouldn't be @ my House until July 6th which was 5 days away! I couldn't pay extra to have delivered sooner or anything BUT it did say I could pay & Pick up @ Whole Foods:/ Yes very Confusing for me too!! I'm so glad that Amazon was unable to accommodate us w/ Formula bcuz Now I found my FAVORITE store! They literally have everything you need! Not only Fresh Meat but Fresh Olive Bar, Cheeses, International Food & A Bakery I date not go into...yet!!  I'm most definitely going back SOON now that Milana will not be 'Jonesing' her Formula & whenever I have couple more Hundred to drop...Again! There was only \"1\" item I wanted & looked up/down aisles for & that was \"Red Cabbage\" I asked a stocker/employee in Veggie aisle & he looked @ me like I was crazed. So I explained \"it's called Red Cabbage but IF you have it in Jars it's more of a Purple Cabbage..\" he told me to hold on & then he was history! Never came back. Oh well, I knew my total was going to be past $100 Easy so I stopped there. Before I forget in closing~ Whole Foods Market has Organic Beauty Supplies/Supplements as well j smelled Devine walking by. I write Beauty Blogs/ reviews for CO's so my personal stock of Beauty Products is enough to open my Own Beauty Shop! Once again just like the Bakery I knew not to go down those Aisles because I'm confident if it's anything like the other Aisles of Goods?~ I would've done Major Damage to my wallet! My 2 girls are happy w/ the Items I found & purchased here & Def recommend to Everyone. "

Items in produce are stored poorly or being obtained from lower quality vendors. Meats were always a high point, but now fewer and fewer products are fresh, with a far more limited selection at the counter and people behind the counter who can't answer basic questions about preparation. Whole Foods pricing has always been infamous, but the quality and selection balanced it. Now, with lower quality and a much more limited selection, justification takes a lot more work. For the last decade, multiple items pulled me to Whole Foods because they were just outstanding. I'm down to 0 now. Plenty of better options at better prices at area Publix and HarrisTeeter stores."

The coffee bar is never open when I get there. They no longer serve the tea I liked so much. The variety of sodas available in the cooler by the bakery sucks. I don't look forward to stopping by WF anymore unless I absolutely need to pick up something. Amazon - you ruined a great thing. Congratulations!"

I highly recommend their bakery, there are excellent choices for everyone, with items that are made completely vegan and others with conventional ingredients.\n\nMost importantly during my visit, is the friendly atmosphere of the employees. Everyone is wonderful, especially Lindsay who is always quick to assist, always friendly and professional. She is one of my faves. Definitely frequent this location \n\nEDIT: I'd like to mention one of their employees, Petra, who is always up beat, high spirited, and never fail in seeking the customer satisfaction."

The fish department staff are always honest as to what is fresh and knowledgeable about advising what to buy.  The rotisserie chicken are quite good!  The staff in the cheese area are very knowledgeable and will steer you in the correct direction for whatever you may need.  There is electric charging stations for their customers.  There always seems to have a least one available when I am shopping this store."
