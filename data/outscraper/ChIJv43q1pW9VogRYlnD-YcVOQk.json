They have high quality beans, and very expensive equipment, yet the espresso is way too bitter. If you get a latte or something that has milk, sugar, etc it will mask it fine and taste good. But I like plain espresso. The first one I got was the worst and most bitter espresso I've ever had. I decided maybe it was an off day or just the flavor, so next time I got the espresso flight. I wanted to taste the different flavors, but they all just tasted sour. I gave it a 3rd try a few weeks later with a different barista, but it was still sour and bad.\n\nI want to support local, but the Starbucks espresso is leaps and bounds better as of right now. Even my cheap espresso maker at home bakers a better cup.\n\nI will still come back again at some point, and hope to be able to change my review to 5 stars soon"

Comfortable for a bit - none of the seating is so comfy after about an hour.  Good place to take your laptop for some work if that's your thing. There's a piano - I've not seen anyone on it since they opened but they do have music regularly. It's got a mid-century modern vibe of white and pastels in velvet. It's cute and makes for a great place to stop off mid day for a coffee break or during your morning routine."

I feel that most coffee shops I go to try to lean towards a more comfortable and vintage atmosphere, but this shop is modern, large, and quiet. It's not what I had expected when I walked in but I was pleasantly surprised. The workers were kind and brought our drinks to us (I wasn't expecting that at all, very hands-on) and the interaction with them was quick but not rushed.\n\nThe coffees we got are the paradise latte (one with purple) and the everything latte. The paradise latte has an ube cold foam, and if you've never had ube, it seems to have a mild yet creamy flavor that compliments the coffee well. The everything latte has a cream cheese cold foam, something I've never seen before, but it's a unique flavor and tastes nice. They also have small bakery items and ice cream. There is plenty of seating and it's nice to just relax and enjoy your coffee.\n\nI recommend this coffee shop if you want to try something new or just sit down and do some work. They have outlets everywhere and wifi."

If you're looking for a completely different feel from the South or any other typical coffee shop, this may be your place. The cashier at the front was kind but the ladies calling out names and giving you your coffee and food at the end of the bar area could have been more friendly. If you're used to walking in, feeling comfortable, and having the kindest people serve and talk to you, this may not be your place. While beautiful, it has a very New York with retro chairs feeling to it which comes with a lack of southern hospitality. The Bagel was great and coffees were good, but I was never asked what kind of milk was okay (I don't know if you are able to do that here, I was much too busy trying to scan over a menu while she was trying to take my order as we had never been there) and we didn't get an extra shot of espresso in either of our drinks that we ordered and we kind of just felt out of place. There is a nice area out back where you can enjoy your coffee outside by the flower beds."
