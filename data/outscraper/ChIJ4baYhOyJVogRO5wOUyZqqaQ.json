How can you say you welcome all but so openly display someone's religion in an incorrect way. I'm not in the business of shoving my religion down anyone's throat, I happily walk into black owned, women owned, veteran owned, minority owned, lgbt owned stores with no hesitation. As long as I don't feel unaccepted or threatened. And sadly as a minority, women, but one who just so happens to believe in Jesus, this store just made me uncomfortable. For the type of people to claim violence over anything, this stores displays and associated attitudes illicit violence. The store attendant even made a snarky comment about a street design shirt my sister wore (that happened to have a psalms verse printed on it). This is not very welcoming or accepting in my opinion. The store looks like it could've had potential to sell nice things but after that comment immediately upon entering, I just didn't feel comfortable to look around to much."

For me personally it felt a bit like a boutique but now they've changed it a lot to where it's more of a hang out place with gifts and home goods to buy while you're there. The wine/beer bar is a great addition! I definitely feel like this is a place for people who have $ to spend to go out. If you don't want to spend any $ don't go in there.   There's a high probability that you will want to purchase an item, a beverage or some food. And, now, you can purchase an experience. They set up tables for crafts and they provide the supplies. A really cool and fun new place to hang out.\nA 3 star is mostly because many items and services that they offer are not \"affordable\" for my personal pocket. But overall I think for others, I've noticed that people send off a 4-5 *star vibe. I'm there often at the cafe/coffee shop, I love the vibe and the people. I'm so thrilled that they opened up the place for people to just hang there and offer us some fresh and quality food and drinks. They really are a special bunch and I'm grateful they are here.\nThis small city really needs a place like this! A local hang out spot with something for everyone. And, they're constantly evolving and thinking of new ideas on how to make things better."

The space is eclectic and interesting and doesn't need much at all in the way of decorating to be a stunning venue. Brittany was so kind and accommodating and responded to my (many) questions quickly. She was so helpful, sending me pictures as I live out of the area, showing some of my family the space so I could see it over FaceTime, and then allowed me to see upstairs when I randomly stopped by while in town. They have a ton of options as far as food, drinks, tables, decor, most anything you can't think to throw a party; however, there is absolutely no pressure to use them if you have other vendors or prefer to DIY. If you're looking for an incredible and unique venue in Rock Hill with the added benefit of supporting a local business that is doing great things for the local community, you've found the perfect place!"

The worker showed me some cheap spoons from India and told me that not all their stuff was from China; they occasionally had stuff from as close as Tennessee but that they were waiting on a shipment to come in. BTW I saw the same holiday spatula's at Target being sold for $1.50. These were marked a lot more. The cup I bought last month for my sister for $15 I saw at Ross's for $5.50! Ridiculous!

I have worked in retail for many years and I have never been treated or treated a customer like this. If your listed hours are on the door, and your customer enters the store before the scheduled closing time, you don't ask them to leave before they are done shopping, much less before the scheduled closing time because you want to go home. Not sure this review will do any good considering the owner will just disregard like she has with every other poor review and claim the patron must be mistaken and thinking of a different store."

I know this store has received a lot of backlash recently that they don't deserve. And just wanted to stop by and show some love!
