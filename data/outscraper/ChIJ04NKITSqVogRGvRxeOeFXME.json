The warm and genuine smiles from the staff were a refreshing contrast to the often-disconnected interactions we encounter in a world filled with discontent. It's amazing how such a simple gesture can leave such a lasting impression. The shop itself has a welcoming ambiance, with a cozy vibe that makes you want to linger a little longer. The staff was knowledgeable and eager to help me choose the perfect blend, making the experience not just a transaction but a genuine interaction. The quality of the separate cup of coffee I purchased speaks for itself, rich and aromatic, and I'm already looking forward to brewing my first cup at home. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my visit and will definitely be back. This is the kind of place that turns a simple errand into an experience you'll look forward to repeating. Highly recommended!"

It is amazing. Fresh, delicate, buttery, incredible flavor. I highly recommend the tomato feta Danish and the blueberry scone. Try dipping bits of your scone in their rotating drip coffee. I tried sweater weather today based on Gabes recommendation.\n\nTheir lattes are awesome as well! Each cup is perfectly crafted with micro foam and a beautiful design. A++\n\nThe shop gives off chill vibes and is full of plants, an upstairs with board games, and plenty of places to sit outside."

Same with the mornings. It's a fun and very aesthetic place to be to hang out with people or get work done. The lack of booths and comfy chairs do make it hard to sit there for longer than an hour or two though if you're trying to spend a good amount of time on some work. It can also get very loud downstairs and upstairs (usually because of college kids). I recommend it more for socializing :)\n\nThe food and drinks are great. It's a little more on the pricey side (close to Starbucks in price). I like their blends of coffee much better than Dunkin donuts so if you're a coffee snob like me, I think they've got pretty good coffee. They have a couple herbal slushies and/or drinks but minimal food. The food will vary, it's always got different foods there. Sadly their avocado toast is gone from their menu."

Small details which makes one choose Summit next time over other places on Main Street however were not there:\nI visited on Wednesday at about 1.30\nI wanted to grab a coffee and quick snack. The baked goods cabinet was pretty empty, no savory to choose from. I was told they had bagels. Then she checked and they were out of bagels. Which is okay if Summit offers bagels in the morning only but that was not was I was told.\nLast thing: The entrance is a beautiful old door, but it doesn't work! I had three or four attempts to enter before a guest finally let me in after seeing me struggle to get in. There were three people behind the counter not busy at the time who did not see me trying to missing t all.\nNote: old doors a beautiful and I understand they might be hard to fix. This one has no handle on it and it wouldn't open when you push it hard. So maybe a note on the door telling me how to enter would be useful. I started to think Summit was closed and almost walked away when the guest helped me.\nAs far as snacks: it would be nice if there were more bagels, croissants or a pack of almonds or something Summit offered for those who wanted savory and to fill up the baked cabinet instead of having nothing to offer. If there are no choices early afternoon people will go elsewhere next time even if they want to support local coffee shops.\nI hope this review is helpful.\nHave a great day."

Left me sitting there for another ten to figure it out and was still unsuccessful. I had to call the bank to get a refund.
