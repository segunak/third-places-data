I can't wait for my next sandwich!\n\nEditing to add: we ate our blueberry cheesecake, chocolate chip cookie, and lemon bar as soon as we got home. Phenomenal.

My drink was ready first and my son's smoothie was in the process of being made when another worker who appeared to be in training still set the same smoothie he had ordered in front of us. My son grabbed it thinking it was his and her response was \"that's not yours, I didm't take your order!\" My son and I looked at each other both bothered by the response and lack of customer service speak. She then asked the girl that took our order if she was making ours and she said yes, that she was getting on it. I appreciate communication and good customer service skills and felt like this trip lacked both. My son is not interested in returning anytime soon, I however will give them another try to see if there is any improvement. I believe in second chances when other experiences have been decent."

As stated before I couldn't enjoy any of the items I bought because they all taste like they were uncovered in a fridge with other items that took over, I threw it all away and drank what I had in the cup.\n\nThis wasn't a great experience for me unfortunately.

They told me there was amazing food, there was amazing pastries, and the coffees were to die for.\n\nI went into the restaurant and ordered caprese sandwich and a bowl of tomato bisque.\n\nThe sandwich was incredible, the balsamic vinaigrette was off the char rich delicious, and the bread was covered in black olives and onion strips, and it was just a fantastic combination for sandwich. The basil pesto was to die, for it was so rich and delicious.\n\nThe tomato bisque was one of the greatest tomato soup I ever changed in my life. To the point, my friend tasted it, and she went and got herself her own bowl because of how incredible it tasted.\n\nThis event was during the festival, where there were so many outside vendors that you could choose to eat from. Which the children did. But we chose to eat inside because we were so excited about the stories how incredible the atmosphere and everything would be.\n\nSo as we're eating, the little girl with us is eating a pizza, that she got from the location outside that was directly in front of their field. There was several other people in the building, including an older gentleman and his wife and his daughter, two younger children, and then another family all eating outside food.\n\nThe kids finished their food the lady and the gentleman and their daughter who was older, we're having conversation yet the employee approached the little girl with us.\n\nShe told us that it was against health coat violation for her to eat outside food inside of their store. Which is incorrect because that is not a health violation anyway shape or form at any restaurant in the world. Because we all have eaten other food in other places. When your kids don't want to eat somewhere and they prefer something else. How many times have you taken them McDonald's chicken nuggets into somewhere.\n\nWe couldn't figure it out, but we didn't understand why the little girl was the only person approached yet the gentleman who was white, the lady and their older child who was white and the children and the younger family on the other side who were white, were clearly sitting there eating outside food.\n\nThe little black girl that was with us was the only person approached. Was it stereotypical racism from someone in that Belmont atmosphere?  It wasn't high enough to be in establishment.?\n\nIt was extremely disheartening, it turned, we wanted our money back. We wanted to leave the restaurant. We did not want to partake in shape or form the success of this business.\n\nYes, we sat there and finished our food. We did not ask for our money back.  And and the little girl asked if she could just finish her pizza. The employee looked around the corner and out the windows at a location where we can go sit outside area, but we did not get up.\n\nThe child's mother who is white, walked up and asked to speak to this woman. And when she asked the woman why she didn't walk around incorrect everyone else in the building. She said it's OK. She can sit there and finish it. You'll just know better next time. But yeah, never said anything to the older couple, the younger couple or the group of children. All happened to be Caucasian.\n\nAnd to top it off, even though myself and her mother were eating their food from there we had beverages from another location so us being white, we weren't corrected either but the little black girl sitting with us was corrected."

Indoor and outdoor seating, kid friendly, not sure about dogs, maybe outside ok. Beer and wine are available. We didn't get any sweets, but they looked tempting. Cute little spot in downtown Belmont. Parking could be an issue during busy times, you may have to walk a block or two. Would love to come back and try other items."

The sandwich features bread packed with flavor and texture, juicy tomatoes, and robust and distinct cheese that comes together to form the complete package. Portion size felt just right. Well worth the price of 10.95.\n\nMake sure you stop by if you're in the area!"

It was our first time, my husband and I, and we went on a Friday evening and it wasn't busy at all, which was great. I was excited and saw they had some appealing items in their window display. We ordered a few desserts (to bring home) and decided to dine in and enjoy a cup of latte with a brisket veggie empanada. We paid for our order and sat down in front of the window display, waiting for our empanada and latte. As we sat waiting, we both witnessed one of the workers handling our empanada with her bare hands and throughout the time that she had transferred it from the window display to the oven(s), she was touching her mouth, her hair, her clothes, her ears and went back to touching the empanada with her unclean hands. I was shocked and reluctantly (bc I didn't want to complain and be \"those\" customers) went to tell the cashier and wanted a refund on the empanada. Somehow, a man from the kitchen, I guess the owner, started talking over the window display to my husband, in which he stood up and walked over to him and the man started explaining that even though they handle their food with bare hands, any and all germs and bacteria that was on that person's bare hands would've been been eliminated while baking/cooking in the 400 degree oven. I was disgusted and appalled that someone would encourage this kind of practice at a restaurant, amidst covid and all the food born illnesses out there. We were calm and explained to him that no one should be handling food with unclean hands (I'm sure there's plastic gloves or a spatula/tong somewhere), but he insisted that his hot ovens were going to kill the bacteria. He assured us he wasn't arguing with us, only \"educating\" us on how it's ok to contaminate food and eliminate bacteria with hot ovens. True or not, no food personnel who cooks and serves to the public (or to anyone) should handle food that way!  Who wants to eat spoiled food, regardless if the hot temperature killed the germs or not, just the thought of the filthy actions of the employee is horrific! Truly flabbergasted! Now I think of it, I should've refunded the desserts too because of his \"bacteria-killing-hot-oven\" theory. Praying that whoever baked the desserts had better and cleaner work ethics.. He really needs to take a serve safe/food safety class!!"

For some reason, certain employees have difficulty with my order (it's not complicated and I explain it very nicely). Today was no exception so I asked to speak to the owner. His response was very out of character as he demanded there would be no more \"special \" drinks allowed. I couldn't believe how rude he was to a loyal customer that just wanted a simple frappe!

The display cases are filled with some of the most creative and classic confections and plenty of savory options for breakfast and lunch. The Empanadas are a must. Loaded with perfectly seasoned meats and veggies, they really don't need the exceptional dipping sauce, but I'm very happy it is added. Professional coffee service with well researched beans show that the owners know their coffee! It's a must try. You won't find this in many places, and I'm glad I found it in such a beautiful little town."
