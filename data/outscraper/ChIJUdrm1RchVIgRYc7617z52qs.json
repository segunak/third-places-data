            "review_text": "From a regular customer over the past couple years, I sincerely hope management considers this feedback. I'm not complaining for the sake of complaining, this shop is in a great location and the vibes are good, but it has some serious flaws that have me visiting maybe every other month as opposed to a couple times a week.\n\n1. Everyone knows the prices are too high for the quality and amount you get. This is standard for the night swim/summit coffee industrial complex. The avocado toast being $9 on a small slice of sandwich bread is hilarious. The drinks only going up to 16 oz would be fine if a 16 oz drip coffee weren't $4.\n\n2. They keep it absolutely freezing in here. When I do visit, this is the thing that always makes me leave earlier than I wanted to. I'm not exaggerating and as someone who's always cold, I'm used to it and always bring a sweater. Even in a sweater I'm cold here, and I look around and see all the women around me wearing sweaters and huddled up too.\n\n3. The coffee is too acidic. Today there was a choice of the house blend or a single origin coffee and I chose the single origin. That was acidic too. All the coffees here separate with cream and that makes an unpleasant texture. If you're going to offer acidic coffee, it'd be great if there were also other options to appeal to a broader range of people. I'm convinced the people who say they like the coffee here are pretending for the sake of coffee snobbery.\n\n4. The avocado toast is dry and bland. The extra seeds/topping on top adds to the dryness of the bread. I'd consider some sort of spread under the avocado and maybe add some pickled red onions/something for some acidity. Also pictured is the giant stem I got on my toast--girl how am I supposed to eat this?"

First of all, you ripped me off on that quiche, that was the absolute smallest piece of quiche I've ever seen--fit for a toddler--and it wasn't even that good at all. You need to call it mini-quiche or it's complete false advertising, and you should be ashamed of yourself for that scam. Not sure how it took them sooo long to heat up that tiny piece that I finished my drink before it even came.  Also, you need bigger sizes than 16 oz iced drinks.....sad excuse for a coffee shop that only has one small size. And also you have a really small pathetic list of flavors for latte syrups. Good luck, you need it."

Any business that removes options for you to pay are compliant in attempting to convert to a  digital banking/cashless society.(Already happening around the globe).  Night and Swim owners are good little compliant foot soldiers who are more than willing to do their part at eroding your  freedoms."

The atmosphere is perfect for work or relaxation, with just the right balance of ambiance and functionality. The fresh, flavorful coffee only added to the experience, making it an ideal spot to get things done while savoring a cup of Joe.\n\nThe barista and staff were not only friendly but also incredibly helpful, which enhanced the overall visit. Their warm service made me feel right at home, and I appreciate their dedication to ensuring a pleasant stay.\n\nDuring my visit, I had the pleasure of trying both the hot Caramel Latte and the iced Caramel Latte, and I must say, they were both outstanding. The hot Caramel Latte was a delightful blend of rich coffee and sweet caramel, creating a warm and comforting beverage that was perfect for the cozy atmosphere of the coffee shop. The iced Caramel Latte, on the other hand, offered a refreshing twist with the same delectable caramel flavor, making it an excellent choice for those looking to beat the heat while sipping on something truly satisfying. These coffee creations only added to the overall appeal of the place, making it a must-visit for coffee enthusiasts and remote workers alike.\n\nI can't recommend this coffee shop highly enough, especially if you're in the area. It's a gem that combines a welcoming atmosphere, great coffee, and exceptional service. Whether you're looking for a productive workspace or simply a delightful coffee break, this place has you covered."

I had mentioned to her that I was in the mood for a latte and a bagel, so she drove us here.\n\nThe place is super cool and clean. Great atmosphere! But the really impressive thing was the staff. I'm about as high-maintenance as one can get, as far as coffee drinks. First off, I asked if my latte could be decaf. (I've worked in restaurants my whole life and I've done barista work, so I'm familiar with the disdain the service industry has for decaf.) Marlo was the person we were giving out order to. They were very friendly and said sure, as long as it was in an espresso drink and not drip coffee. I'm assuming this meant they have decaf espresso beans but not regular decaf beans. My last restaurant was the opposite, so I get it. I wanted a latte in any case, so I was excited.\n\nI just kept thinking of other things to add or change, like adding their HOUSE-MADE caramel. Two pumps, please. And can I get almond milk? Do you toast your bagels? (Another very popular coffee house that will not be named doesn't toast theirs and I REALLY wanted it toasted.) With every question, Marlo answered without outward rancor, hahaha, and remained friendly and positive. They never once made me feel like a Karen from hell. Delayni (sorry if I butchered the spelling) was equally as nice and friendly, and took my everything bagel to the kitchen pass to be toasted.\n\nMy latte and my daughter's black coffee came up quickly, along with a\nbeautiful bagel and large sides of butter and cream cheese I'd ordered. We sat inside for a few minutes and then decided to move out to the big patio because the weather was so nice.\n\nI will recommend this place to everyone I meet. Just by being nice, the staff got a customer for life. (Sorry, guys, hahaha. I'll try to always come in with my daughter so you get a balance!)"

I had the iced \"Tiramisu'\" drink made with oat milk and my daughter had the \"Tropic like it's hot\" iced drink which includes matcha, mango syrup and some other things top with Tajin seasoning. These both have wonderful flavors so we ordered the same items this visit. The coffee shop is cute and pretty quiet. Service was a tad slow today but there were only 2 people working. I do wish they had an option of size choices but it is all one size.I like the taste of the coffee in my drink so definitely will be going back for a more simple coffee."

I had an oat milk latte, hot. Simple, but delicious, a favorite of mine, so I would be particular. I saw in another review, a complaint about hot drinks in clear glasses? Stating that they won't stay hot? I am a habitually slow drinker. I take forever to sip on a hot drink. On this cold day today, my hot drink had no issues staying hot in the clear glass vessel. And, bonus points, it's super pretty!! As I explore my new neighborhood more, I definitely hope to return to Night Swim."
