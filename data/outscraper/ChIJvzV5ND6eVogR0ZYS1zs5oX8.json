All I can say is WOW. I drink a lot of matcha and today, this was the best matcha I've ever had. I give all the credit to Tim, the barista who really put the time and love into my matcha. This is such a huge deal for me because 9/10 times I order matcha, it's usually a chalky consistency. But it was so creamy and well built, that I will only have Tim make my drink from now on! As a barista myself, I know when you have a great experience like this, it always makes you come back for more. So if you're reading this Tim, THANK YOU!\n\nEDIT - 12/18/23\nScout is such a beast and love his energy. I was in a hurry and needed some pumps of vanilla and was willing to pay (because I only like Starbucks vanilla syrup) and he remembered me and helped me out! Thanks so much, you're awesome!!"

I totally understand mistakes happen, but it's happened a couple times at this location and it is a pretty big let down to have to skip breakfast even though you paid for one and drove to get it. Customizations should be taken seriously, if I hadn't noticed and bit into it I could've gotten sick, had to miss work, etc. I decided to try to at least get my money back and was unable to get my call answered. I called again and again and several times the phone was picked up and I was immediately hung up on. I didn't feel like I should have to drive out of my way to go into a Starbucks and physically ask for a refund when it was their mistake. After tying to call for hours and getting hung up on, I eventually decided to call the general Starbucks number and had to use half my lunch break on the phone to get a refund. This Starbucks needs to seriously pay attention to modifications and not hang up on customers. It was all such an ordeal when it didn't need to me. I will not be going to this Starbucks again."

She grabbed my name and put me down for a credit on file!\n\nHere is the best part - so on my break I go to the Starbucks and the situation was absolutely recovered!! Dave was amazing!! And he makes an amazing White Chocolate Mocha Latte \nSuch great conversation & service from this gentleman!!\nNot going to lie, I am totally in awe.. I typically steer away from Starbucks in Harris Teeter locations because I don't feel like the service is ever good. But boy was I proved wrong today!!! And seeing as I now work only a few minutes up the road, I will absolutely be back!!\n\nDAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY DAY!! Hopefully you can teach others to be that incredible!!"

I visited here frequently while working close, and often food could Not stay on the shelf and sometimes all gone before my 12:00 lunch!! Harris Teeter came in handy a few times. Nice indoor seating area, more Starbucks should have that!!! Messed my frappuccino up more than twice but I ordered more than 40 from here, over time. Over all, I can't say it is the worst or best Starbucks. WhiteTruck Just In"
