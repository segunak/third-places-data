The coffee was a light/medium roast and was quite good but not our personal favorite.  The tea was excellent.  We ordered the quiche and a stinger.  The quiche was amazing but the stinger was super dry, did not contain much meat, and was difficult to eat.  We would not get the stinger again but we would eat the quiche all day long.  The location is great and there is plenty of parking out back.  The atmosphere here was really great.  We will definitely be back if only for the quiche and to try a different type of coffee.  Nice place to chill out if you are in the Mint Hill area!"

Try choc chip bar and zucchini loaf! It also is family friendly, I brought toddler and infant sons here recently and my boys had so much fun. Employers are great. What I mean by this is that they actually are doing their job. In my judgment, they actually enjoying their job perhaps because of atmosphere. I appreciate their willingness to communicate with me as a deaf faithful costumer. Thank you for your excellent serving, FTH!"

My husband and I were out running errands and I needed a pick me up so instead trying to find a Starbucks we wanted to try local instead, which is what we prefer. Upon entering, the atmosphere is very chill and quaint, but the service was extremely lacking. When we got to the counter we were met with a rude, blank stare just waiting for our order with no hello or welcome, and then a \"what are you having\". I told the girl it was our first time there and we didn't see the coffee menu (to explain our delay in ordering) and she just stood there with no reply, no beckoning to where the menu was, nor a recommendation. We eventually looked around and found the menu and ordered 2 Americanos (we would've ordered more with suggestion or even friendliness but decided against it). After getting our EXTREMELY HOT coffees, we tried adding sugar to them but it melted the straws and couldn't stir. After getting into the car, the coffees were too hot to drink and started to warp the lids and coffee cups. Now I'm sitting here, pulled over in a parking lot writing this review with hot coffee ALL OVER ME and my car because just picking the cup up made the coffee burst up from the cup, popping up the lid. I STILL haven't even gotten a chance to taste my coffee! If I had the time I would've gone back to complain in person. The sad part is that if the service had been better, friendlier, maybe I wouldn't be as upset, but her rudeness almost made me feel as if this was almost on purpose....as a person of color, I would hate to think this was the reason for a 4.9 reviewed coffee house to deliver such poor service..."

Their zucchini bread is so moist and delicious that I was thinking about it after I left the first time. The hot chai was also pretty good. It was a little sweet today but it still hit the spot on a rainy day.\n\nThey have anything from jazz to alternative music on their record player which really completes the atmosphere and allows you to settle in. There are also various rooms and spots where you can enjoy your coffee and baked goods. The spacious parking lot in the back is a huge plus too. This is an all around great place to grab a coffee and chill, and I will happily continue supporting this business!"

I also had their bagel egg, cheese, and bacon sandwich, it was excellent. There are multiple rooms for privacy, and as soon as you walk in there's a little spot with a record player with some vinyl. If you're a college student, this could be a great spot as well. Aside from coffee,, this place also sells wine, beer, and tea!\n\nRebecca and Kirra were so nice and awesome! Very efficient with great customer service! Very family friendly place.. Make sure to check this little spot out!"

We will try coming in earlier in the day, sometime soon, to try a latte where we can have regular espresso and revise later."
