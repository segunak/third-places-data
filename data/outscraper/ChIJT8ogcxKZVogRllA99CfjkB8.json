If you want to go for a chat then this place is great, if you want to grab a coffee to go then be prepared to wait. I go to Thousand Hills at least once a week and not once can I get my drink and leave within 20 minutes. I've always chalked it up to being busy but today at 2:30 with no orders being worked on and no one in line I placed my order for 2 periwinkle lattes, went to say hi to a friend sitting at a table, and came back to the counter 10 minutes later as my Uber had arrived and I assumed my coffee would be ready only to see that the barista had not even started my coffees as they were talking to someone the entire time. She then proceeded to tell us it'd be a few more minutes when asked how much longer it would be and made one drink at a time.\n\nThe coffee is incredible but I cannot fathom that after 10+ times of it taking over 20 minutes to get my coffee that I'm the only one complaining so I'm not sure why this hasn't changed."

I have taken his coffee made entirely wrong before and would've never complained. But I do not want to return somewhere where I am spoken to unfairly for simply misunderstanding a soft spoken barista in a very noisy cafe."

The barista was so accommodating and helpful and even made me aware about the smaller size of the bread, etc. :) Although I've had a couple experiences here that weren't great bc of long wait times or a rude experience, and although I never write reviews, this just made my night after a long day. I'm not sure what her name was, but you're my fav! <3\n\nAlso, food is good and coffee is delicious :)"

I stood for a few minutes but she was still busy so I said to her I'm going to sit(she said okay) just to give her time to finish up the other orders. I sat at a table directly in front of the register (no more than 4 ft away) for about 15 minutes waiting for her to let me know she was ready to take my order. A family walked in and she also made them wait for a moment and proceeded to take their order right in front of me. I  said I've been waiting a long time and she then said to me she couldn't come to the table to take my order (which I never expected her to do) I was waiting for her to gesture to me she was able to take my order and she said she couldn't even do that.

I ordered ahead on ToastTab, paying ~$38 for two paninis and two drinks. It gave me an time frame to make of 15 minutes, but we waited solidly more like 20-25 minutes. The store was not super busy so not sure why we had to wait so long for our drinks, as the food came out on time.\nUnfortunately, the drinks were so bad, it was honestly a waste of the $15 we paid for them. $8 for a dirty chai and it tasted like it was burnt...and another $7 for a london fog which was essentially water and some syrup. Granted, these prices were after tax + a tip, but still it's way too much to pay for essentially what felt like a ripoff. It was a very very disappointing experience, and my partner and I both left wanting to ask for our money and time back since this essentially was a waste. I'm leaving two stars since my prior experiences have been okay and I like the mission, but I would not recommend this coffee shop."

They have incredible coffee, cold brew, oat milk, vegan items, a brand new seasonal menu, 16 beers on tap, a fantastic cocktail program, kombucha, cider beers, desserts, games, TV's, chill couches, private office space, literally could go on. It's a great spot for meetings, interviews, hanging with friends and they have live music most Friday nights with food trucks. I can't say enough great things about this place and they are always adapting and adding new items based on poling their guests and residents. I heard they will be carrying fresh produce soon which will be very convenient. I come down some nights for a bottle of wine, grab a cocktail before I catch the light rail, or play pool with friends. The nice part is they are open until 9pm most nights! I highly recommend coming to check out their coffee, food and environment - it's a great location at the Scaleybark light rail station and currently have free garage and street parking!"

Pastries are mediocre, it would be better to just get a pastry from local bakeries nearby. Would not recommend anymore. I've watched this place fall tremendously. Definitely take your time and money somewhere else."

            "review_text": "As a resident who's been with LTH from it's birth at Novel, I have been incredibly disappointed and unsatisfied with what has become of this beautiful coffee shop. When it first opened, the staff was AWESOME and the vibe was unmatched. There was a sense of community, the staff was welcoming, actually cared about how you were doing and asked about where you'd been if they didn't see you for awhile. I actually knew staff NAMES and was excited to come see my friends who would always make me the most delicious cup of coffee. The staff before would see my boyfriend and I, waiting in line and by the time we'd get to the front, our order would already be waiting for us. Carlos, Mackenzie, Maggie, Deja and Tyler were the absolute best people that could've worked at that coffee shop. Now, there's new management. The menus for both coffee, drinks and food have changed. The prices are INSANE. $10 for a yogurt, $11 for a smoothie. And to top it off, the perks of being a resident have slowly dissipated (free refill on coffee with a special mug, 10% discount, etc). If you're willing to pay close to $8-$9 for a vanilla oat milk latte, this is your place.\nThere is no sense of community anymore. A group of us, every Friday, would come to the coffee shop for Food Truck Fridays, listen to the amazing live music and have fun. Now, the place is DEAD on the weekends, there's no more food trucks or trivia. There's hardly ever live music and when there is, it's incredibly weird elevator music. The staff is not educated well enough to be serving cocktails - nor do they make the cocktails they used to have on the menu, even though they still have all of the ingredients for them. Everyone here is incredibly rude/stuck up, especially the new management. This place really was like a family. Now, this place will never have my business. I won't even go here out of desperation. Save your money and brew your own $6 bag of coffee from Harris Teeter. This place is not the vibe.\nBTW, my boyfriend was LITERALLY charged $1 EXTRA for getting a cold brew without ice...and was not given his 10% resident discount because after almost a year, they stopped honoring it.. Who does that?! Rude, greedy, way over priced, horrible customer service."

Even after seeing I already took of my jacket and bookbag, and set up my laptop, he asked me if I wanted my order to go. And I sat next to the register and he didn't ask anyone else the entire 3 hours I was studying there if they wanted their orders to go. That made it indirectly very clear I was just not welcomed. I guess the barista don't like serving black people or something. Or was told to be rude to black customers, idk he was just not as friendly to me as everyone is saying in the reviews and to the other customers. Crazy thing is also, No one else seemed like they cared that a black college girl was on her laptop studying for classes except that barista. Also he did a weird hard look away from me when giving me my drink. I was none the less a paying customer studying. Not someone loitering and I tipped him, which I regret. So yeah I wouldn't come here if your black they are going to purposefully make you feel unwelcomed. And your going to regret giving them your money, like I did."

What I found was a much more than  a coffee shop-   this feels more like a modern restaurant/lounge.\n\nFirst- the service is outstanding. Starting with Carlos, the team here is the best I have seen in a long time.  Maggie, Hazel and the team in the morning are very welcoming and accommodate almost any request for coffee/ food (e.g. I do not like Onions- so they made me a breakfast burrito without pico de gallo).\n\nOther pluses:   The location is new, clean and modern.  Large windows create a well lit and bright environment.   The tall ceiling (2 floors) ensures that you can work here for an hour or two and avoid smelling like burnt coffee when you leave.\n\nThe music is appropriate but not overbearing like some other coffee shops.\n\nSeating-  lots of seating- and comfortable seating.\n\nStart to finish- my new place 100%.   Great quality product, great location and friendly intuitive service.   Excellent."

I am a big time coffee drinker and spend most days working from coffee shops.\n\nIf this is anything like the  quality of the Atlanta locations, this a welcome addition to Charlotte's specialty (third-wave) coffee scene and provides another coffee shop of similar quality to Under Current and Not Just Coffee.  Land of Thousand Hills specializes exclusively in Rawandaan Coffee and has close partnership with specific farms. Their menu is pretty diverse offering traditional pour overs, drip coffee, lattes along with more Starbucks-esque offerings."
