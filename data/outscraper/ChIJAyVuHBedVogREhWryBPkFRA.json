Since my neighborhood Earthfare closed a couple of years ago, I drive 25 minutes to go to the Ballantyne store\nWent today at 2 pm for daily special chicken and chuck for 3.99. They were out of the chicken and the chuck was going to be 25 minute wait for 2 lbs. The clerk said people came in early and bought all the chicken and lots of individual chuck lbs. I asked for a raincheck but was told they can't do that. Manager would not even come out to tell me personally, instead sending message via cashier. I'm extremely disappointed after driving all this way for  NOTHING. There should be a limit to the amount one person can buy to allow the deals to extend to others. I also saw a very elderly man hobble all the way in the store only to be told the same thing. Sad watching him leave empty handed as well. Earthfare...you can manage better than that."

However, we're from out of town and where we live, there is no Earth Fare. Last time we were here, the attendant at the smoothie bar made us some delicious fresh drinks and made fun conversation with us. That really elevated our experience at the store. This time, we encountered two young men who smelled like 'grass' and spent most of their time either picking food from the hot bar for themselves, sat down in the guest area, or on their phones outside. They didn't care to answer any questions pertaining to the smoothie offerings and even told us the bar was closed to get rid of us. This is an opportunity to be more conscious about hiring and/or training your employees, Earth Fare. Your employees generally don't give the impression that they want to be there, so why should we want to? This is not how you get people to come back. Otherwise, prices are pretty high, but it's a fine store."

The store wasn't in the best condition, but I understand due to the short-staffing.\nI came back into the store to give them one more shot, & man is it a night & day difference! The grocery isle looked fully-stocked (the best it has looked in months) & the customer service experience was a lot better (not Chick-Fil-A level, but who can compare to them).\nI was looking for one of my southern favorites, Pimento cheese! However, they didn't have it at the time I was shopping. Instead, I opted to try the veggie wrap & I was surprised on how fresh the ingredients were. The cucumbers were crisp, & the hummus had an unexpected smokiness to it. Now it is one of my go-to's whenever I go to Earth Fare.\nOverall, the whole experience was a large step up from when I visited back in early 2022. I would recommend to everyone, to give this place a shot."

He alerted the young man and he never came to cut the pizza and put the utensils out.\nI waited while he finished up with a customer and went on to say I'll take the next person. Well we were the next customer.... he said we needed to wait as he shouted for the next customer. The man behind us was confused especially since he knew we were there first. As myself and 3 other customers at this point were waiting for self serve pizza.\nI've very disappointed with this interaction as I typically come to Earthfare. This is not the type of customer service we should be given. There are other places during my lunchtime in the area I can spend my money at.\nI do not want to give money to a company who's vision does not understand the importance of customer service and how consumers spend their time during their work day.\n\nUpdate: Thomas the store manager called almost immediately and made this right! He apologized for the service inconvenience and was very receptive. Thomas is an asset to Earthfare and a great team member of management! Thanks again for your great customer service Thomas!"

Talon, the cashier, comes across as hating her job. The other cashier, who had override capability, had no idea how to ring up bulk food products. I realized that the manager of this store does not read google reviews. So I am sure nothing will be done to correct this. So, if I am going to be overcharged for organic groceries, I will go to Whole Foods. At least their cashiers smile and check you out quickly."

Apparently the \"sale\" items only apply to members but instead of the cashier saying anything or offer to see if I wanted a membership she clearly could care less and was ok charging me more than twice what items cost elsewhere simply because I was unaware I needed a membership to get the \"sale\" price. Maybe this is in fine print somewhere but definitely not anywhere apparent. And I thought the cashier would have at least said something about a membership rather than charging me double what I was expecting to pay. By the time I realized what happened she had already charged my card and I was so frustrated I just left. Will never be back here."

Finally, the young lady asked for her change. Apparently she asked for cash back from her transaction. It was so frustrating because the woman working behind the counter didn't acknowledge that people were there waiting. And, she looked at the lady who asked for her change like she was crazy with no apology. When she gave her her change, she left the counter again and started working on making something else. I finally left to go to the front registers. As much as I like the salad bar, I will never be back. There are no many other choices."

Example: bruised up apples, moldy blueberries, brown broccoli, and over ripe fruit.\n\nThe front entrance of the store is consistently dirty and often has an odor.  For example: the floor has trash and dirt (sometimes the same trash that was there the last time I visited) and carts are left sticky and dirty.  They are often out of hand wipes as well.\n\nIn addition, the customer service in the supplement/beauty area has been very poor.  One particular woman has been quite impatient and rude the last few times that I have approached her with questions, not to mention she lacked knowledge. In the past they have had some wonderful people working, but their customer service throughout the store has definitely declined. Unfortunate!"
