They had 3 ladies in the back looking through the window. Took another 6 minutes for any of them to come to the ordering counter.\nSecond, we ordered half dozen donut holes and a strawberry shortcake donut.\nThe holes were dry and oddly flavored for original, vanilla.\nThe strawberry shortcake, while heavily filled with strawberry cream, tasted nothing like strawberry,  and was albeit, salty for some strange reason.\nThe whole experience was a bust."

The donut itself was delicious, with a perfect balance of texture and flavors. The Salty is a classy establishment with a great atmosphere, making it a lovely spot to treat yourself in the heart of Charlotte.\n\nNotes:\n-it's relatively pricier than other donut shops serving the same  yeast-raised donuts.\n-if you're not from Charlotte or familiar with the area, make sure you know where to park, or you have a mobile parking app because it took us quite some time to find a place to park."

My brother in law got the strawberry and I tasted it and it was dry as well. It had some sort of artificial strawberry flavor if you could even call it that. My husband is now hesitant to try his. I will not be ordering these again. I'm all for local doughnut shops with specialty doughnuts but not these. Dunkin' has \"cake\" type doughnuts and they are even better than these were which is saying a lot because I HATE Dunkin Doughnuts."

But if you want something that is complex and delicious that you can enjoy slowly then for sure come to The Salty Donut. A word of advice on how to eat them, do not try and eat an entire donut in one sitting, or else you can have a rush of sugar and it can be overwhelming. Instead cut off pieces of it maybe 1/4 at a time to really enjoy it."

Maya Ash said I can't because the computer doesn't print to me a Cancellation Receipt.\nI told her how come? She wrote her name on pick up receipt!

My eyes were fully focused on the yummy display filled with cookies, donuts, and pastries. Everything looked so tasty. There are many options to put a dent in your taste buds. I decided to go with the milk chocolate donut and the cinnamon cereal ice coffee. My donut was light and fluffy in the inside with a nice creamy sweet taste from the chocolate icing on the outside. The coffee was really good. The staff spoke as soon as we came through the door. Now, parking can be a beast with limited parking in the front.

It was a great balance of sweet and salty for his lack of sweet tooth. Hope they keep it!\n\nMilk and cookies is SUPER sweet (i have a strong sweet tooth) I enjoy but have to split it among 2 days. Same with the chai, also SUPER delicious but sooo sweet.\nUbe pina colada doughnut texture, taste, and frosting are my favorite. The only part im not a fan of is the filling. Not bad just not for me. Otherwise it would be my ultimate favorite.\nThus the Boston cream doughnut is my #1 choice here. Never know what to get? This creamy, comforting, sweet piece of smooth heaven is the choice!\n\n$5 = 5 star baked goods!\n\nI also enjoy their jasmine tea and my partner enjoyed the peach cobbler iced coffee. Make sure you stir the coffee each time before sipping otherwise just get a strong smoky coffee flavor (not bad just syrup settles)"

I got the Milk & Cookies, Mango Passion Fruit White Chocolate, and a Chocolate Chip Sea Salt.\n\nThe donuts have a unique flavor profile. I can taste the shortening used as it leaves a slight after taste. Also, the brioche seems over proofed as it is a tad bit tough to chew.

I also want to state that the employees are hard working and helpful.\n\nI pick up donuts on my way to my volunteer gig which is early. Most places aren't open, so I was thrilled when Salty Donut opened up and opened early and their stuff was great, so why am I leaving a 2 star rating?\n\nBecause the last three times I have been in early - around 7:10, maybe only one or two donuts are ready, so I leave empty handed and have to scramble for some other places I can go get something for the volunteers. Now, if this were a coffee shop that had donuts, I wouldn't be disappointed. But this a donut shop that has coffee. I'm not trying to be a pain but if you offer donuts and you open at 7am, I should have some expectations that donuts will be available to buy.\n\nAs I stated, employees are working hard and what they produce is really good-especially the donut holes, so it's not people being slack. I'm not sure what the timing issue is, but if most donuts can't be ready at 7 when you open, maybe opening at 7 won't work. I'll be sad, but it beats being frustrated. I can't be told to come back in 30-45 minutes to pick up donuts that I need now, and again, if donuts won't be ready until 7:45 why open at 7. Maybe its just for the coffee, but I get coffee there because I am getting donuts.\n\nAnyway, the donuts and employees are great, the timing is just an issue. I'll keep recommending you all, but only if people are going after 8am. I'd love to return because volunteers love the donuts, but I can't keep going and leaving with nothing. Thank you for listening to this issue."

The difference came in the form of a invitation and gift card to return an allow them to demonstrate their normal customer experience - proof is in the experience and we will return to fairly allow them to show their commitment. Stay tuned for my update from that experience. I am very hope forklift\n\nDisappointed with the experience! The brewed coffee was not hot enough and the order was screwed up. The most difficult thing to accept is that it was not very crowded. Donuts we did get were tasty but they vomited the one that I really wanted which completely screwed up the whole experience. Don't think I will be returning because of that experience - spent more than $60 for the disappointment!"

We read some of the not so great ones as well, but decided to give them a try anyway because the great reviews outweigh the bad ones. Well, should've listened to the not so great ones. These were so disappointing. The presentation of the donuts and the cute box they come in is so misleading. The donut itself (the plain parts with no icing) taste like bland bread. I didn't realize until after reading the owner's response that the donuts were brioche, well... they taste like it. I couldn't get past the texture of the donut to enjoy it as a whole. My sister and I both tried the Strawberry Shortcake one and the Original and wasn't impressed. We both stated the Strawberry one left an aftertaste. With each donut at roughly $4, I really wanted to return them and get my money back as we literally tried a piece of all of them thinking it would get better. I threw $20 of bread away. Not sure how this place received so many great reviews. I would say visit to see if it's just my tastebuds. I'll stick to MJ's Donuts in Pineville or MoMo's donuts in Rock Hill as they're more of to the donut I'm used to."

They were absolutely delicious and fresh. They were nothing like the mass-produced version that I had loathed in the past.\n\nEvery doughnut we tried was spectacular and the ButterBeer doughnut had the taste of being filled with cookie butter, which was divine.\n\nMy favorite part about the doughnuts was that they were balanced and not at all too sweet. Hence the name \"the Salty Donut\" I suppose *shrug*.\n\nI also loved the vibe of the store. It was relaxed and people were chilling and reading. The staff was kind and helpful even as they delivered orders to customers. That is so rare in Charlotte to find a relaxed place even amongst the customer service chaos.\n\nWe will definitely be back. Thank you for being amazing.\n\nWe tried: the butterbeer doughnut, traditional glazed donut holes, and the cinnamon brown sugar cake donut holes"

Once our order was ready the donut that we chose the first option was also ready and being so nice gave us the donut for free. That was very generous and unexpected. We really appreciated the hospitality.\nWe finally ate the donuts which was the traditional glaze - very good, good texture\nPb&j( it had jelly inside) - unexpected, but a nice party in my mouth kind of donut\nAlmond mocha- was so good! Texture was like a cake.\nMilk and cookies was also a good choose.\nI would absolutely come back to this shop, but my favorite of all was the traditional glaze."

The chocolate on the Boston creme is almost inedible, same with the mocha almond donut - I say this as a huge chocolate lover because it's rare I dislike any chocolate, of any kind.

I understood if they were busy and couldn't do it but they went above and beyond!! It's a beautiful drawing done by Lilly or Lillie (I hope I spelt that right!) she was so sweet and deserves a raise! She made my day! The donuts and pop tart were delicious as usual. I've been here once before and both times were amazing! Beautiful interior, lovely conversation, and killer donuts! I love them and will be back! Thank you again, Lilly master of drawing, my husband was so surprised and loved it! Also, the pop tart is really really good and so are the donuts! If you haven't tried this place and are still thinking about it. Just do it! Who doesn't love coffee, donuts and a good time? "

I ordered ahead twice and each time I still had to wait (they only start making it upon arrival. I've watched several people who ordered in-store get their orders before me). First world problems BUT with limited parking in the area, it would be beneficial to run in, grab, and go. I understand wanting to provide fresh hot bevies but it's on us to pick up in a timely manner."
