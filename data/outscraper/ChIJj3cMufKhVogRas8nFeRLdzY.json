I tend to be quite picky about coffee, as lots of cafes in the area often leave me disappointed, but not Giddy Goat. I've been here a few times now, and have had multiple different drinks, and they're all great. Recently, I had a Vietnamese cold brew here, and it quite literally is my favorite cup of coffee i've ever had. Super light and creamy, it had a similar experience to drinking a beer as it had a head and a base, it was phenomenal. I've also had a couple scones from here and they were great, I can't speak for the empanadas as I haven't tried them, but they look great. Overall, this place has all 5 stars for me. Great atmosphere, one of the best for coffee shops in the area, and the coffee is the best in my opinion. This is my go to for coffee, and you should try it too, you won't be disappointed."

The shop had some cute merch and coffee beans too. Clean bathroom.  The only hard part is parking. Close parking is hard to find and so we went to  a paid lot and it was 10 dollars for 2 hours. A little spendy but the area is cute. We walked around a little bit up and down the street to get some more time in. All in all, I would highly recommend."

We took our first sips a few miles down the road - otherwise I would of said something in person.\n\nJust really horrible - super bitter. Please do better.

Since it's always busy here the parking lot is regularly full. Furthermore... the empanadas. The flavor is on point. I've tried every empanada and honestly I love them but sometimes I can't get past the raw dough in the middle and on the bottom. They need a minimum of another 5 minutes in the oven since they aren't fried. Check the bottoms! I would love to see the crust a more golden brown across the entire pastry and not just a few spots on the top.\n\nPros: coffee! Love that they roast their own coffee. It's delicious. The staff that serves it up is always polite, personable, and kind. The overall environment at giddy goat is amazing. A great sense of community. You can tell that people love coming here. The atmosphere is perfect for meet ups, business, college students, family. I also love that GG does coffee and workouts, yoga and coffee, and dance lessons. There's also live music almost every week and tons of local art for sale.\n\nI come here regularly and will continue to do so. As soon as I see those empanadas not as raw.. the 5th star will come.\n\nI wish y'all great business!\n\nReview update 12/20/23\n\nAsked for more color on the empanadas.. got more color on them. They are glorious! Rich golden brown and crispy outside. As always the flavor is on point."

It isn't that it was bad, but my taste buds would prefer a chai latte or another specialty coffee over this. However, the empanadas were phenomenal! The meat was super tender inside the patagonia empanada and the spinach empanada was packed with a tasty filling. They were both flakey and delicious. The chimichurri and red sauce both paired well with the empanadas too. There is indoor and outdoor seating, and they also have a small parking lot. If you strike out on the parking lot, there is additional street parking that isn't too hard to find in the area. I will definitely be back here again for empanadas in the future!"

I recommend spinach and breakfast empanada, which I got!! Boyfriend got the very popular breakfast burrito, said it was pretty good. I really like this place, but felt that it was cramped. We sat outside which was nice but it was a little chilly. I would come back just for the empanadas!!"

They truly are leading the way in how coffee shops are ran. They compost and welcome you to bring your own cup. All while using reusable cups for in house purchases. They also compost working with Queen City compost. They have amazing food, especially the empanadas! I had their vegan empanadas today and they were delicious, filling, and mouthwatering. They also have vegan cinnamon bread and vegan lemon power balls! For non vegans there is also so many lovely, delicious items to choose from. My favorite before going vegan are their croissants. The chocolate croissants are a must try! They also offer space to rent for parties, gatherings, and buisness.\n\nI remember when this place opened and I am so happy to see Giddy Goat thriving. Please visit this coffee shop and bring your own cup if you have one!"

The service was 10/10-the perfect blend of polite and prompt. It was interesting to read the story behind their interesting name as well.\n\nThey also serve burritos and alcohol including beer and wine.\n\nThere's a small-ish parking lot outside.

They roast to a perfect consistency and the coffee is never too bitter, sour and has nice balance of roast, earth notes and brightness.  As well, the coffeeshop has a real cozy and homey feel being in an older building in the heart of Plaza Midwood with beautiful towering oaks around it.  The upstairs bar and sitting area also is spectacular.   I have yet to try the food, but the Empanadas are home made and the cook is from Argentina.  They smell so good and I plan on trying them soon.   If you are fortunate to see when Enzo does the roasting, the coffee roaster is located in the open in the shop and you can watch him mix and roast beans which is a cool sight to see!"

Ate a breakfast empanada and a cappuccino and bought 3 bags of the deliciously fresh roaster coffee for later."
