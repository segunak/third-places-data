Prices are more economical than some other cafes in the area, which makes me come here more than the others (I'm tired of paying $7-8 for a latte at other cafes.) They also have good bfast and lunch options. My only critique is the lack of gluten-free bread, which is a pretty easy option for cafes to have these days (GF bread can be kept in a freezer or fridge for a long time without going bad.) I love the nice atmosphere with a chill, peaceful vibe. Great place to get some writing done. Thank you!"

So far, I have had their Morning Fog with oat milk and just a hot Masala Chai.\nThe service is friendly, the place is very clean and the ambiance is nice. Most tables have charging stations or outlets and the do offer wifi. They also have some outdoor seating for the beautiful weather.\nThey offer a wide selection of non-dairy milks which I appreciate.\nMy sister has had their coffee and she is a fan. Not bitter and they make it super hot just how she likes them.\nShopping center has parking though it may get a little tight during busy hours. Highly recommend."
