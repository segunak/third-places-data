The service was excellent and the owner was kind and worked upfront with her employees which I really liked and it seemed like a really great work environment. The only drawback I had is the lack of seating but it is kinda a granted because of the small building but full 5 stars would highly recommend!"

Mariah, the cashier was also awesome!  The other staff, Mariah, and the owners checked on us during our visit.  I can't wait to go back!  I'm craving a scone!"
