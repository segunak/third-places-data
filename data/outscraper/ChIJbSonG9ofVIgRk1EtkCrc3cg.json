It's one of our favorite places to go whenever we visit Charlotte.\n\nWe like coming here in the mornings to do remote work - they have coffee, pastries (try the vegan coffee cake if they have it!), and plenty of comfortable seating.\n\nThen of course there is the beer - they have a nice variety of styles, and some really creative ones. A few summers ago they had a mango smoothie sour that they served as a slushie with a Tajin rim, and it was so good I still think about it today \n\nWe've also really liked everything we've tried off their menu of pizza and sandwiches (very vegan-friendly), and enjoyed checking out the bottle shop downstairs.\n\nOverall highly recommend this place, and can't wait til our next visit!"

You order your beverages and food at the bar and the food is brought to you.\n\nMy wife is Gluten free so she had the Jazzy Belle Beet Salad with roasted beets,arugula,gorgonzola,pistachios and balsamic vinaigrette. A lot going on but blended well\n\nWe also tried the Latin Lingo pizza with chicken,roasted corn,onion,jalapenos,Parm cheese ( they were out of Cotija) cilantro and a Spicey creme base...extremely flavorful  but I think would have beej better with the Cotija.\n\nAlso had the Humble Mumble pizza which was pesto,garlic,chicken,feta,EVOO,tomato and calabrian Chiles. Lots going on with this pizza!\n\nFor a very relaxed setting with unique pizza flavors,this is a fun place to go."

            "review_text": "Hadn't been to Salud quite some time, except for coffee, and decided to check it out for dinner and beers a few weeks ago. We arrived and ordered our beers and pizza then sat down. While we waited on our pizzas, we finished our beers and ordered another round. A couple sat next to us about 10 mins after we arrived and ordered and had already received their food by then (also pizzas). We gave it about 10 more minutes, having waited over 45 minutes at this point, so my husband went to confirm if our order was placed since we had been waiting so long that every table that ordered food around us had all gotten theirs, except us.\n\nThe bartender sent a staff member out to our table a few minutes later. She was rude, didn't greet us at all and just asked \"you guys ordered about five minutes ago right?\". We told them we ordered almost an hour ago and she told us that since we had just placed our order that it would be another 20 minutes since 8 pizzas were ahead of us. Super clear they just forgot to ring in our order but the response to blame us after ordering over an hour prior was wild. When we got our pizza 1.5 hours later, it was terrible. I've heard others rave about it so I'm not sure why it was so bad, but we ate two pieces since we waited so long then left.\n\nWe sent an email to the restaurant just to let them know what happened, in lieu of writing a bad review for a local place. We allowed a few weeks for response and never heard back, which makes this experience worse. We have always loved the beer selection and vibe at Salud and so we are super disappointed in this experience. Maybe we'll go back for just beers at some point, but unlikely."

The interior has great vibes, we love coming here to play board/card games on their big tables, and they always have really unique and interesting beers on draft, like a PB&J sour, so it's fun to get a flight.\n\nGiving it four stars (rather than 5) for two main detractors:\n1. The food is unfortunately not great. I've given the food a solid like 3 or 4 tries and just have never enjoyed it. It just always feel really overwhelmed with toppings, and the flavor is never amazing. This might be a personal preference, but I prefer smaller diced toppings so you get a little bit of everything with each bite. Salud's pizza's all have thick cut toppings so you can only get one thing each bite, and you never really taste the cheese or sauce.\n\n2. I just wish they rotated their draft beers a little more often!"

I'm a huge fan of milkshakes and sours and they have a lot of options. The classic Buffalo wings were delicious. Saucy and crunchy and their homemade blue cheese sauce is outrageous. We wanted to try one of the JonG specialty pizzas. It took almost an hour. Apparently they dropped it when it was coming out and didn't charge us, but it was a very long wait. I know the pizza is not so great in Charlotte but it was pretty good. The crust was crunchy and the toppings were great but I had a higher expectation. We had extra blue cheese sauce from the wings and dipped the crust in it - that was really really good. Highly recommend doing that. Will definitely go back. "
