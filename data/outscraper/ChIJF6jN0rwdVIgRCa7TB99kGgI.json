Everywhere you look, you discover something new.\n\nNow, let's talk coffee. Pistachio latte was my choice.  I am very picky with the texture of milk in my lattes and Vavelas milk, wow. It was so incredibly creamy; I seriously couldn't stop drinking it. They had a wide variety of drinks to order. My friend got the Dubai Chocolate Frappuccino (which is one of their specials) and it was literally perfect. We also ordered a pastrami sandwich and a Nutella waffle. Let's just say we cleared the plate. The sauce on the sandwich is unlike anything I have tried before.\n\nThe staff was extremely attentive and friendly and gave good advice on what to order.\n\n1,000% will be my go to spot from now on. Please do yourself a favor and check them out."

The inviting aroma of fresh coffee and the warm, friendly staff made for a great first impression.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy yet modern--perfect for catching up with friends or getting some work done. Their signature dubia frap was smooth and expertly crafted, and the menu offers a great variety of coffee and treats. I also tried a flaky, buttery cheese cake that was absolutely delicious.\n\nWith top-quality coffee, tasty pastries, and excellent service, Valvela cafe is a must-visit. I'll definitely be back soon!"
