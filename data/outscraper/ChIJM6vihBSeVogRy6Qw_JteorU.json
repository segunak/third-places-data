The prominent and most stocked brand in a white packaging is of course (WFM). You will NOT find a variety of other known brands. Watermelon in a 32oz container was $17. Thats no typo folks, they wanted your girl to pay $17 of her coins for watermelon. Ok not going to lie. i considered it. Presentation looked fresh  sweet and ripe, and though everyone i made eye contact and smiled at, readily returned a warm and friendly smile. The only other persons that look like me was my companion and the cashier? I think they heard about the price of Watermelon  at Whole Foods Market.  Oh and my drinkable (Siggi's) yogurt   VERY reasonably priced. "

None of the number added up and no one could explain to me how they got to that price when numbers we were looked at didn't work. 2+2 did not equal 4!! They said customer service will know name and number of district manager.\nBEWARE of that call center because they just don't get it. It's not a language barrier as I was born in that country but grew up in the US bi explained it to them in their language the best I could but they just weren't getting it!\nI don't know how they do business!! It is the worst experience I've ever had spending $800 in a retail establishment and I can't get a correct answer!!  Avoid the off shore customer service at all cost!!

The clerk told him to walk to his car and get it.  He had maybe 10 items.  8 minutes later he comes back.   I told her I would gladly scan my card so he can have the prime specials. But no.  Holdup the line for 10 minutes while we wait so he can save a $1.00. He had 10 items for gods sake.  Geeze. This is the stupidity you deal with at the checkout.\n\nToday a produce employee was stocking carrots.  I asked him if they were out of limes as there were none out   He looked at the empty shelf and said we are out. We don't have any. He made no effort to look in the back.  5 minutes later he sees a box with limes.  Oh hey, here are some limes! You're in luck.  OMG.\n\nHere's another annoying thing it seems  they will charge an item incorrectly charging you organic when it's not.  especially lemons and avocados. It happened today on my lemon.  It had a scan sticker with the number but they charged me organic price.  I watch the price on the monitor while they scan my items or check my receipt before I head out.  They have no way of returning your money over the phone.  You have to remember to take your receipt back on your next visit.  How convenient for Whole Foods.\n\nMy experience with management is they are disinterested in your feedback. When I say something they look at me like I have a third eye.   I personally think it's a management issue at the CLT store.\n\nThey need to talk with Harris Teeter as they truly get customer service.  Harris Teeter is working on their organic food section    When they do I will never step foot back into Whole Foods.  Their employees lack of enthusiasm and good customer service is maddening to me.  They can do better.  Frankly, Whole Foods is too expensive.\n\nBtw, you can call Harris Teeter and they will refund your overcharges right over the phone.  They get it."

The bread section is poor, little variety and the few fresh breads they bake are always out. The penut butter machine is always empty and if you request for it to be filled, no peanuts and they look at you as you are NUTS. Produce during Thanksgiving was old.

Before the person filling in handed it to me, pizza guy cam back and said they can't do that and said it would actually about $6 more and would be charged as individual slices.

They are rude to disabled people, I've seen it myself at the uptown location asking a disabled customer if they could read. It's pitiful.

I've been trying to solve this problem for two months now, but nothing works out, they blatantly lie and hypocrite in your eyes, and no one does anything.  Maybe whole foods makes a profit this way, I would not like to believe in it.

You wouldn't think that a grocery store is an excellent place to hang out, but this Whole Food is a staple for many.\n\nAs a grocery store it is very clean, organized, and has high quality products. For daily shopping I find it to be too expensive and would really only shop there to get specialty items like vegan or vegetarian supplements. The wine and beer selection is decent, but other stores have a bigger selection. The staff has always been friendly and helpful which I appreciate. The bar keep is always on point too which helps."

Not only did Whole Foods have it, but they had several varieties. I was eyeing the teriyaki & mango habanero flavors, but I did the right thing & tried one of the zero sugar flavors.\n\nI joke & call WF \"whole check\" because they can be pricey.

The store is very clean and the shelves are very neat. I also find some of the brands interesting because I have never seen them before and I try them out sometimes. I am learning to venture out more and open up my world a little bit.\nI shop at Aldi for the big bulk paper products, meats, fish, fruits and vegetables. When I need to get something specific I can always find it at Harris Teeter or Compare.\nI am originally from NY and have been here over a year now. What I find interesting about Whole Foods is the interaction with the staff. Half the staff is nice and friendly and customer centric. If you are looking for a product they will let you know where it is located, if they changed it to another aisle, or if they are out and what stores near-by may carry it.\nI find this is a plus because it is a sign of a good company and a well trained staff.\nThe other half looks annoyed to be there, and act like they are suffering through some kind of punishment. Sometimes I look at them in the eyes and they avoid any kind of interaction. A simple and friendly hello would be enough for me.\nThis is what I call a friendly light place and maybe it is a Charlotte thing. They are polite but they really don't want any kind of interaction with other people. I get it because that is how NY people are. We are are always in a rush to catch a train, bus, or cab to and from work and the people that get in our way are just annoying.\nI know this is a rough job market, but why on earth would you take a job dealing directly with the public if you don't really enjoy being around people."

Many other items not available. Organic strawberries purchased had no taste.  I could go on but I won't. Not the Whole Foods quality anymore."
