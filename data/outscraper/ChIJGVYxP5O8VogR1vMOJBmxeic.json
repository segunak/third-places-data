Holly during my travels in Charlotte, and it's been my go-to for the past two weeks.\n\nHere's the scoop: killer coffee, killer playlists, and killer pastries--all at prices that will make you smile. Plus, if you're in need of a workspace, they've got you covered with plenty of outlets and desks.\n\nBut what really sets this place apart is the vibe. It's like Cheers, but with coffee. Everyone knows each other, and the owners and staff treat you like family. Seriously... I've never experienced customer service this good.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: it's worth the drive. Whether you're coming from Belmont, the airport, or anywhere in Charlotte, trust me, it's worth it. I've traveled the country for work and stopped in my fair share of coffee shops, but if I could take one back home with me, this would be it.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Swing by Catawba Coffee Co. and join the family.\n\nYou won't regret it!"

The physical marketing of this place lacks, you could barely tell this id a coffee shop from the outside. I am guessing their revenue comes mostly from the locals that know. Lastly, and most regrettably,  the coffee used to make lattes, not sure if that's their main blend, I believe it to me Guatemalan coffee, tasted just like mean mug coffee co, and in my opinion just doesn't have a good taste.

I was hoping that they'd offer mugs instead of takeaway cups, but their only options are Styrofoam cups. I'd rather not be poisoned with microplastics while drinking my coffee or contribute to Styrofoam in landfill waste (it can take up to 500 years to decompose!) so I will not be coming here again and I cannot recommend it to others."

And then she finally stops what she is doing . Mind you didn't say what can I get you . No greeting no words lol. So finally I just ordered and I'm like I'll take a ice latte caramel please with 4 sugar and she's like YOU CAN PUT THAT IN YOURSELF OUT THERE.. I was like ok ... thats fine . Most coffee spots I go to put it in but anyways lmao like WTH is all the rudeness and being cut off like that for ?? Esci when it wasn't even busy.. no one I mean no one was in there .. then .. afterwards I tasted the coffee and it was watered down and no espresso just milk and watered down. She clearly can't make a coffee to save her life either . So maybe that's why she was so pressed. Anyways won't be back . Got racist vibes from that shop & lady."

Very delicious.\n\nI think my favorite thing to say about this place is definitely how accurate the descriptions of the drinks are. In every specialty drink I've tried, I could taste every flavor they listed on the menu without one being too overpowering. The employees really know what they're doing. Would also say very reasonable price for the drinks. $4.25 for a very enjoyable and high quality coffee is absolutely worth it to me.\n\nWould recommend their cookies when they have them as well! Take a seat and finish some work, too, this place is perfect for just getting together with friends or studying for an exam."

We moved to the area at the beginning of the year and having been coming just about every week since. It is such a calm and quaint shop, the employees are always kind and welcoming! My boyfriend has had his tried and true drink since the start and I have had fun trying different ones! My favorite has been the buttery pumpkin latte  I also really like the mocha lavender! Both drinks have the right amount of coffee/espresso, oat milk, and sweet for me! We also typically snag a muffin, scone or bagel while we're there! So yummy too \nAll in all we love this shop and will always come back to support and get our coffee fix! If I could give them more than 5 stars I would."

We were in another shop when I overheard another customer mention her spiced cider. I asked her where she got it and she told me how good it was and the name of the shop. So I finished shopping and put it in the phone for directions and off we went. I highly recommend this coffee shop and plan to visit the cute little town of Mt Holly while you are there.. We were just heading there for the cider but spent time there checking out all the shops. The people there were so friendly and I will make sure to stop in on next visit to the area. I just wished I had known about this little hidden gem sooner!!! Make plans to visit Mt Holly soon!!"

            "review_text": "An Evaluation of Catawba Coffee Co.\nToday people rely on caffeine, whether it is a business woman who needs a boost on a Monday morning or a college student writing an essay the night before it is due. A warm, and tasty option for caffeine is coffee, which may be brewed at home or bought at any number of fast food restaurants, but nothing can beat the brewed beverages of an accredited coffee shop. Coffee shops are such popular places to hang out, they are even featured on television, like in the sitcom Friends. Locally owned coffee shops are always nice places to visit, and Catawba Coffee Co. is no exception. Catawba Coffee is a pleasant place to be, it is a truly terrific coffee shop with nothing to complain about.\nCatawba Coffee Co. has a wide variety of menu options. With drinks such as the Americano and the Zebra Mocha latte, their menu stretches from A to Z. At affordable price points, one could buy beverages in four sizes: short, tall, grande and extra large. While coffee is the most popular choice, non-caffeinated beverages are also an option. There are plenty of smoothies and hot teas to choose from, as well as hot chocolate. While enjoying a coffee one might think \"I wish I had something to go with this\", Catawba Coffee sells home-made muffins, danishes, brownies, cookies, and other sweet treats.\nSanitation is a top priority for anyone in the foodservice industry, and this is apparent at Catawba Coffee. They sweep, mop, and clean the tables every night so their customers won't walk in to a dirty store the next day. The manager cares very much about customer satisfaction. if someone gives the store a negative review she will reach out to them to get their feedback, so it won't be a recurring problem. The employees are also very friendly and are on a first name basis with most regular customers. They love their jobs and their attitudes reflect that.\nWhen someone walks into Catawba Coffee they are greeted by a warm color scheme, soft lighting, a quiet song on the radio, and--obviously--the smell of fresh coffee. The creme walls, decorated with works from local artists, go well with the dark-red tile floor and the brown furniture. The string of lights and spotlights on the ceiling gives the shop plenty of light without being too harsh. When someone first gets to the counter and take a look at the hand-painted menu you may be overwhelmed by all the choices, but the barista will happily make a recommendation if you can't decide what you want.\nSomething else that makes Catawba Coffee a nice place to go to is all the things one can do there. There is a variety of board games if someone is there with a friend, and if one is there alone they could take a look at the bookshelf, filled with plenty of books to read. On Fridays, as well as the occasional Saturday, there is live acoustic music in the evenings and the shop fills with people by seven o'clock.\nCatawba Coffee Co. is a great family-friendly coffee shop to visit, with a large enough variety that anyone can find something that he or she will like. It has dedicated and hard-working employees who love interacting with customers. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, you will feel comfortable and calm because of the warm, tranquil atmosphere."

I am a black coffee man and Catawba's Coffee is great but lately I've been drinking the dirty chai and it's fantastic! The best I've had in the area and 100 times better than the big coffee chain! If you stumble across this review I hope you give Catawba a try!"

Coffee is relatively inexpensive unless you're getting a specialty drink like lattes but even then, it's less than a chain. They also have a rewards program with a punch card system for free coffee and specialty drinks. It's buy 10 of a respective type of drink and get one free. They also have some bakery items as well that look amazing. I've only tried their blueberry scone but it was really good. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the downtown Mount Holly area."
