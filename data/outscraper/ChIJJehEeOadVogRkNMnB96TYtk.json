And also important - the coffee, matcha and food are AMAZING! Today I had a pistachio baklava latte - iced at TK's recommendation - and it was such a cool combination of flavor.  I also got a banana nut muffin, which I happily munched on driving back to my house. So yummy!\n\nI'm happy I found Backyard Brew and highly recommend everyone trying them out "

We've been to EASILY over 100+ different coffee shops and this one really stood out. I ordered the banana bread latte and gingerbread and they were made with love and care.

The burrito had a spicy kick to it when I really enjoyed. The pancakes were fluffy to perfection and the  pistachio spread and rose water syrup were delicious! I usually don't get lattes but everyone in the reviews mentioned it so I had to try it. I really enjoyed it because it wasn't loaded with artificial sweeteners, and the maple syrup in the latte tied the drink together. I look forward to stopping there again for breakfast and coffee the next time in Charlotte! Also Badr is a great guy. He helped carry my baby carriage down the stairs."

Before I came in I read about them on their website (which I would highly recommend doing, it's such a cool and innovative way to make coffee). The inside is covered with people's art and scribbles, it was really fun to walk around and look at everything. Overall, I would highly recommend stopping by! There's a ton of outdoor seating and fire pits to sit and chill. Although I do wish I got the pancakes instead of the cinnamon roll... guess you'll be seeing me again soon \n\nAs I was writing this our barista came out and turned on the fire table for us! Amazing service! So kind!"

The atmosphere is so fun and the outdoor area is great. Lastly, the coffee itself is delicious and they have a lot of unique options with mediterranean spices. The best part is you can customize exactly how sweet you want your latte. This is now my go-to spot."

We're from Baltimore, it's a lot worse over there. The vibes outside the cafe were nice. Inside, it was dirty and messy with construction going on. We ordered the pistachio baklava latte with oat milk, a decaf cappuccino with almond milk, and pistachio croissant. The latte was watery. The cappuccino was extremely sour. I've had hundreds of cappuccinos decaf and whatnot in countless cafes and I've never had one as sour as this. I can usually drink or eat things that I don't love, no problem. I couldn't finish this. Pistachio croissant was fantastic and the service was nice. All this to say, I'm sure the great reviews have their merit, but our experience was definitely subpar to say the least."

Every coffee I have had from Backyard Brew has made me feel amazing after, in a way that chain shops like Starbucks and Dunkin simply can't. The beans are roasted there, and the flavors and sweetness levels are seperate, meaning having a flavored coffee that isn't as sweet as somewhere like Starbucks is always on the table. The specialty coffees are also delicious and always unique.\nThe staff is always kind and helpful, and there are some delightful inside and outside areas for doing work or catching up with a friend. It's a great and relaxed ambiance.\nOne thing to note... you can't really get an (iced) coffee under about $6. Not necessarily the worst thing, as the coffee is WELL worth it, but just something to note. (And the coffee is still priced similarly to starbucks, so it is definitely worth it for the quality)."

This coffee shop has become a Thursday AND weekend staple! What makes this place special is the ingredients they use to create their speciality coffees. No syrups. No junk. They make everything in house and can customize sweetness and flavor profiles to your liking. Tried the breakfast burrito and was not disappointed. I recommend the Banana bread latte to accompany it! This is a locally owned establishment that I'll continue to support. There's parking located behind the house and ample seating inside and outside. You'll leave here wanting to come back!"

The owners remember orders of regular guests and today,  T.K. remembered my name, not because I told him, but because he listened to me and my colleague talking to one another as we waited for our order.

The owners have put so much soul in this little house and remember their customers, have intentional conversations with each one and the best part?! You get a lucky ducky for every visit!!! Truly the little things make this place worth the 5 stars they get. Our top favorite is the banana bread latte right now! Their chai mix is made in house from scratch and can't wait to try it next"

So many offerings caught my eye, that I had to return the next day for an almond joy latte, which was incredibly yummy too!\n\nThe owners are so friendly and take time to ask about your taste preferences to craft the perfect drink for you. The atmosphere is very inviting! A friend and I enjoyed coffee in one of the Adirondack chairs on the front lawn. There's also a cozy front porch and indoor seating.\n\nHighly recommend and already looking forward to my next visit!"

            "review_text": "Backyard Brew is in a word: incredible. Regretfully, I drove past this cottage gem many times, hurrying here or there, since their opening. I WAS MISSING OUT.\n\nSo glad I finally made a point to stop. This was my third visit in less than two weeks and each experience as well as orders have been nothing short of amazing. BB's coffee and espresso are literally so so good -- flavorfully robust yet smooth, not watery or weak, and well-balanced. Tastes \"pure\".\n\nAs one who loves coffee and prefers each  served with intensity, BB's more than surpasses my expectations. I also believe theirs would be agreeable to most palettes, even those preferring the lesser end of the coffee-forward spectrum.\n\nI applaud their many options and allowances for customizations. Their list of flavors, most if not all organic and natural extracts, make for some of the best iced lattes I've ever had. For example, banana extract and mint leaf additions, fresh grown on site.\n\nI want to first promote their coffee and menu as legit but haven't even scratched the surface of why this ranks for me as one of the greatest, if not best, coffee houses in Charlotte. Besides their tasty offerings, Backyard Brew is family owned and operated by some of the most wonderful personalities and kind dispositions I've encountered. Their Jordanian heritage (some German, too, if not mistaken) brings an extra genuine warmth, knowledge, and hospitable flair to the already top notch service. Not only are they welcoming and inclusive of all, they literally go out of their way to acknowledge, inquire, and connect with each and every patron. Special shout outs to PK, Badar, and Hannah for your kindness, as well as the rest of the staff.\n\nFurther, just when you think the delicious drinks, food, and hospitality are enough -- BB outdoes themselves again by fostering a creative and encouraging environment. Adults and children alike are free to write, draw, and express on literally everything inside from the walls to the table tops. It is just stellar.\n\nIn summary, I could praise on and on, but Backyard Brew is quite simply magnificent. This will be my new hub going forward and I'm excited for more amazing visits. Give them a try, you won't regret it!\n\n features:\n- Large Iced Nutella Mocha Latte (hazelnut + mocha profile customized with oat milk substitution plus banana extract & raw mint; large bevs auto come with double espresso = four shots, the flavor ratio is just right -- not overpowering or sickeningly sweet, well balanced for coffee to shine through)\npaired with a Pistachio Croissant (generous portion that's enough to share or have leftovers, has both pistachio spread and crumbled toppings)\n- The ever phenomenal Badar and PK (L to R) manning the cutest coffee window\n- Family photo of my pup, Violet, and me enjoying the outdoor seating and sun\n- Fireplace doodle: a mere preview of the eclectic interior writing and art\n- Inspirational messages left by patrons"

I'd say we're well versed in the coffee shops in the area and appreciate good quality coffee but this feels like a hidden gem and has the personality that some coffee shops lack because these owners clearly LOVE what they do and are so proud of what they offer. They care about your experience and go above and beyond in their service. They make everything from scratch in house using things like organic sugar and local honey etc. And they're super flexible on accommodating your order, making it less sweet etc. And it's not just the coffee that's great, the food (had the burrito and banana bread) are truly delicious and not over priced like a lot of things in CLT. Absolutely coming back to experience more soon."

We got the pistachio baklava latte and banana bread latte - both were made to perfection!! We also got the pistachio croissant, I think it was the best croissant I've had in my life? And I'm not even being dramatic. Please come here, you won't regret it."

With so many intriguing choices, this help was appreciated. Aside from the coffee (which was fresh and flavorful), the lentil soup was EVERYTHING I needed on a chilly fall day. It came in a cup, so we walked around the area and enjoyed the meal on the go. The whole thing was quite clever and practical.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the atmosphere. The porch has a big table (plenty of room for several people to spread out their belongings) and a cozy, couched seating area paired with a heater.\n\nI can't wait to see how Backyard Brew expands within the building and Charlotte. Yall are the best! Will be back for more soup and coffee, and to try those pistachio pancakes.\n\nCheers,\nKatie"

My friend basically made me go here because she said it was so good and honestly -- it was better.\n\nI love how it's a family business and they use all natural ingredients (no synthetic flavoring)... but what really stood out was the energy. Ryan, the owner, is so authentic and caring. I'm usually someone who wants to be left alone but he chatted with me lightly and offered to let me try the pancakes which were sublime. Then I watched as he knew the next woman's order by memory and before another man walked up with his baby and dog he placed a dog treat on the counter .\n\nI was in a rush and this place made me forget. It felt like one of the most real interactions I've had with another human, food, and place in awhile. Needles to say, I'll be back and bringing friends. I can't wait to try the tea next!\n\nStrongly recommend the dessert rose latte. It's got lovely fall aromatic vibes."
