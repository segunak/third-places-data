Every coffee I have had from Backyard Brew has made me feel amazing after, in a way that chain shops like Starbucks and Dunkin simply can't. The beans are roasted there, and the flavors and sweetness levels are seperate, meaning having a flavored coffee that isn't as sweet as somewhere like Starbucks is always on the table. The specialty coffees are also delicious and always unique.\nThe staff is always kind and helpful, and there are some delightful inside and outside areas for doing work or catching up with a friend. It's a great and relaxed ambiance.\nOne thing to note... you can't really get an (iced) coffee under about $6. Not necessarily the worst thing, as the coffee is WELL worth it, but just something to note. (And the coffee is still priced similarly to starbucks, so it is definitely worth it for the quality)."

Would 100% recommend and will be visiting frequently."

To keep the customer energy going into the day before workweek. Love it!\nWe explained that this was our first time here and gave us a detailed rundown of the place. Then he placed two little ducks in front of us as we looked over the menu. Cool, right!\nWe both ordered the Golden Latte one hot and one cold. It definitely had a great fresh coffee herbal blend taste.\nNow, them Jordanian Cakes were a light fluffy rose sweet taste with a hint of cardamom and flakes of pistachio. Which made each bite rewarding.\nThere were plenty of alphabetical parking spaces in the back. They even have a place to take a cool selfie spot near the parking. Nice for any type of outing."

This coffee shop has become a Thursday AND weekend staple! What makes this place special is the ingredients they use to create their speciality coffees. No syrups. No junk. They make everything in house and can customize sweetness and flavor profiles to your liking. Tried the breakfast burrito and was not disappointed. I recommend the Banana bread latte to accompany it! This is a locally owned establishment that I'll continue to support. There's parking located behind the house and ample seating inside and outside. You'll leave here wanting to come back!"

The owners remember orders of regular guests and today,  T.K. remembered my name, not because I told him, but because he listened to me and my colleague talking to one another as we waited for our order.

The owners have put so much soul in this little house and remember their customers, have intentional conversations with each one and the best part?! You get a lucky ducky for every visit!!! Truly the little things make this place worth the 5 stars they get. Our top favorite is the banana bread latte right now! Their chai mix is made in house from scratch and can't wait to try it next"

So many offerings caught my eye, that I had to return the next day for an almond joy latte, which was incredibly yummy too!\n\nThe owners are so friendly and take time to ask about your taste preferences to craft the perfect drink for you. The atmosphere is very inviting! A friend and I enjoyed coffee in one of the Adirondack chairs on the front lawn. There's also a cozy front porch and indoor seating.\n\nHighly recommend and already looking forward to my next visit!"

            "review_text": "Backyard Brew is in a word: incredible. Regretfully, I drove past this cottage gem many times, hurrying here or there, since their opening. I WAS MISSING OUT.\n\nSo glad I finally made a point to stop. This was my third visit in less than two weeks and each experience as well as orders have been nothing short of amazing. BB's coffee and espresso are literally so so good -- flavorfully robust yet smooth, not watery or weak, and well-balanced. Tastes \"pure\".\n\nAs one who loves coffee and prefers each  served with intensity, BB's more than surpasses my expectations. I also believe theirs would be agreeable to most palettes, even those preferring the lesser end of the coffee-forward spectrum.\n\nI applaud their many options and allowances for customizations. Their list of flavors, most if not all organic and natural extracts, make for some of the best iced lattes I've ever had. For example, banana extract and mint leaf additions, fresh grown on site.\n\nI want to first promote their coffee and menu as legit but haven't even scratched the surface of why this ranks for me as one of the greatest, if not best, coffee houses in Charlotte. Besides their tasty offerings, Backyard Brew is family owned and operated by some of the most wonderful personalities and kind dispositions I've encountered. Their Jordanian heritage (some German, too, if not mistaken) brings an extra genuine warmth, knowledge, and hospitable flair to the already top notch service. Not only are they welcoming and inclusive of all, they literally go out of their way to acknowledge, inquire, and connect with each and every patron. Special shout outs to PK, Badar, and Hannah for your kindness, as well as the rest of the staff.\n\nFurther, just when you think the delicious drinks, food, and hospitality are enough -- BB outdoes themselves again by fostering a creative and encouraging environment. Adults and children alike are free to write, draw, and express on literally everything inside from the walls to the table tops. It is just stellar.\n\nIn summary, I could praise on and on, but Backyard Brew is quite simply magnificent. This will be my new hub going forward and I'm excited for more amazing visits. Give them a try, you won't regret it!\n\n features:\n- Large Iced Nutella Mocha Latte (hazelnut + mocha profile customized with oat milk substitution plus banana extract & raw mint; large bevs auto come with double espresso = four shots, the flavor ratio is just right -- not overpowering or sickeningly sweet, well balanced for coffee to shine through)\npaired with a Pistachio Croissant (generous portion that's enough to share or have leftovers, has both pistachio spread and crumbled toppings)\n- The ever phenomenal Badar and PK (L to R) manning the cutest coffee window\n- Family photo of my pup, Violet, and me enjoying the outdoor seating and sun\n- Fireplace doodle: a mere preview of the eclectic interior writing and art\n- Inspirational messages left by patrons"

The wall art and guest provided inspiration is a wonderful experience to a great product. our almond croissant and coffees where beyond expectations. I'm glad to see such a great group of people growing and improving their business. Everything is handmade. Highly recommended. Every coffee shop we go to will now be compared to this one.

They care about your experience and go above and beyond in their service. They make everything from scratch in house using things like organic sugar and local honey etc. And they're super flexible on accommodating your order, making it less sweet etc. And it's not just the coffee that's great, the food (had the burrito and banana bread) are truly delicious and not over priced like a lot of things in CLT. Absolutely coming back to experience more soon."

It came in a cup, so we walked around the area and enjoyed the meal on the go. The whole thing was quite clever and practical.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the atmosphere. The porch has a big table (plenty of room for several people to spread out their belongings) and a cozy, couched seating area paired with a heater.\n\nI can't wait to see how Backyard Brew expands within the building and Charlotte. Yall are the best! Will be back for more soup and coffee, and to try those pistachio pancakes.\n\nCheers,\nKatie"

Ryan, the owner, is so authentic and caring. I'm usually someone who wants to be left alone but he chatted with me lightly and offered to let me try the pancakes which were sublime. Then I watched as he knew the next woman's order by memory and before another man walked up with his baby and dog he placed a dog treat on the counter .\n\nI was in a rush and this place made me forget. It felt like one of the most real interactions I've had with another human, food, and place in awhile. Needles to say, I'll be back and bringing friends. I can't wait to try the tea next!\n\nStrongly recommend the dessert rose latte. It's got lovely fall aromatic vibes."

I told the gentlemen that I wasn't a \"fancy\" drinker. I like things simple and light. He recommended a medium roast latte with some vanilla (no sugar). IT DID NOT disappoint. I stood there and enjoyed about half the cup and then left for work.\nI just sat down at my desk, took off the lid, and the smell that greeted my nose was incredible. I am not a food critic so I lack the vocabulary to describe the smell in essenses or notes but I don't have to. All I need to tell you is that the aroma was inviting, enticing, alluring.\nIf you're in the Pineville area treat yourself to something other coffee stores can never really duplicate for their McDonalds-esque presence - a truly wonderful cup of coffee and a truly warm welcoming; oh, and a slice of heaven called baklava."

Authentic flat white and freshly made bite size baklava (with or without chocolate). Perfect Latte, too and those with a sweet tooth will love their specialty drinks from Nutella Mocha to Almond Joy, Oh Canada, Nitro Brew, Matcha and Dirty Chai. There's also caffeine free drinks like Fresh Lemonade, Jamaica and Kids Hot Chocolate. It's a drive thru or sit down -- with the full backyard set up still in the making."
