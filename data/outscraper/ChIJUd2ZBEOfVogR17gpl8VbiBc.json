We stood there for at least five minutes and I had to ask the chatting servers to help us and they seemed annoyed they had to stop and actually work. My friend got Turtle Cheesecake and I got what I was told was lemon and coconut cake. I asked three different servers and none were sure. Well, it was not lemon, maybe passion fruit or mango - glad I'm not deathly allergic since I asked 3 of them to confirm.\n\nWe get back to our hotel room, excited to relax and eat our sweet treats. I am sad to report, they were disgusting and dry. Absolutely inedible. I took one bite of the not-lemon cake and it was dry and the curd had turned to the texture of a gummie bear. If I'm being honest, I think that slice of cake was a week or more old. The same story on the Turtle Cheesecake. Both full pieces of cake are in the trash. If we were closer, I would walk them back and ask for a refund. I wish I had read the reviews before going. We would have picked a different sweet shop."

My friend got the breakfast burrito and it just had egg in it, no beans, no salsa, or any other ingredients listed. The rest of the food was okay. We always get espresso martinis here and this time it was awful. Our server was completely unprofessional, I couldn't even tell you her name because she did not greet our table, basically just walked up and said \"what do you want to drink?\" and when she took our drink order couldn't even remember what we just told her. She never refilled our water glasses, we had to ask the guy who ran our food. All while the other employees were sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant on their phones in sight of customers. We also said our goodbyes and thank you to the server and she just pushed past us with an attitude and said nothing. I'm not sure if a manager was even present because we never saw one but there should have been one on staff. This was not worth my $45."

I don't think I'll be back, unless it's to pick up some packaged food or drinks. I will for sure stick to my tried and true Rhino Market for sandwiches. I ordered the perfect pesto caprese sandwich (hold the chicken) and it came out being one piece of mozzarella with a mountain of greens with olive oil and balsamic on a toasted baguette. There was no tomato and you would think that since I didn't have chicken and it was the same price, they would perhaps add an additional piece of cheese and be sure the rest of the components were there (tomato, pesto). Very disappointing first experience and absolutely nothing to set this place apart from the many other lunch spots in south end. 4 stars for atmosphere because it is cute inside."

Even though we believed him, I had the Cobb salad with steak and my friend had the hot honey sandwich! Food was delicious. Well seasoned, warm and served quickly. I asked for my steak rare and it was perfectly cooked. The bartender and server was amazing. They also had the beignets which were a little hard, but still very tasty! We had the mimosa special that was $15 for a juice and champagne. A little weak but for 15 bucks, I can't complain. Will definitely go back."

Plus -- the place was practically empty, so it wasn't because they were busy.\n\nThankfully there was a different barista that when I showed her, she took one look at it and remade an iced latte for me, which is why I'm giving three stars instead of one.\n\nSteer away from the matcha. We got food as well which was fine.\n\nVibes are cute though and plenty of space to work with your laptop."

I ordered a lemonade and she didn't provide any instruction to get the beverage.\n\nWe chose a table and we're waiting for our food when a bartender walked by and asked if everything was ok. I asked for a drink menu and inquired on booster seats. He said let me check on the seats and walked away to never return. We were seated right across from the bar so he could clearly see us and made no effort to follow up on the booster seats, rather they had them or not, nor provide the drink menu.\n\nThe food was not good. Fries served cold, the pasta salad was horrible, tasted mostly of olives.\n\nA manager walked by and inquired on or satisfaction. I told her my thoughts on the pasta salad and she completely ignored the feedback, commenting on my babies and walking away.\n\nI have no desire to ever return to this restaurant. I don't even want to be in the vicinity lol. A true waste of money."

It intrigued me and felt like a wonderful place to work. It seemed as though they really cared about making your experience great and serving excellent food. As I spent more time there, I started to notice some pretty significant red flags. This was a lesson to me to always trust my intuition. When I first got hired, there were already big communication issues, and I wasn't being kept updated like prior jobs have done for me. I noticed it got worse, especially when management got busy.\nThe management seemed super stressed and all over the place, which really isn't great. They're supposed to be the calm in the storm, keeping everything running smoothly. Instead, the whole atmosphere felt chaotic and disorganized, which definitely took away from the dining experience. It felt like there was a bigger problem with how the staff was trained and managed. From my experience, it just didn't stack up to other places I've worked at in the food industry. It seemed like a lot of the staff were new, which means they have a high turnover rate. That's never a good sign. There were promises made that weren't kept, and I felt like I was told a lot of things that just weren't true.\nThere was also this noticeable tension among the team, making me think there are some real issues with how things are run and how people are treated. Additionally, I felt my pay rates weren't transparent and honest, which added to my concerns. Despite The Salted Melon having what seems like a cool menu and a lot of potential, the way it's being managed and the internal problems are just too big to ignore. It's pretty disappointing to see a place that could be amazing fall short like this. Until they get their act together and sort out these issues, I just can't recommend going there."

The hosts were friendly, our waiter Robbie was terrific, the manager came to check in and help with things, and there was live music, which we didn't expect. Atmosphere was very cute and upbeat with plants and cozy colors, and the food was terrific. We got fun drinks, apps, entrees, and desert.

I went to the register again and asked for an update (as they seemed to be ignoring us at our very visible table). The manager said the screen wasn't on in the kitchen and they were starting our food now (no apology). I said I'd like our checks refunded, and she obliged. I returned to the table.\n\nWe waited another 20 minutes in the empty cafe before we decided to leave. We told the bartender what was going on and that we were calling it, who did apologize (though it wasn't his fault at all).\n\nWhat a waste of time! Never again. We walked down the street to Flower Child where we got good service as always!!"

They do have side street parking if you are lucky enough to snag a spot or a parking garage, but I believe they do not validate parking. Upon entering, they have a little store set up with a lot of spices, snacks, and jams to look at. This is on the more casual side. You go up to the counter, place your order, and then go sit wherever you'd like, and they bring the food out. I ordered the Street Car bowl. It comes with steak, corn, rice, beans, roasted tomatoes, and red peppers. I also ordered their truffle fries. Now the bowl, tbh was very bland and not tasteful at all. I was initially put off by the THREE pieces of steak they decided to give me. THREE! I ended up cutting them into tiny pieces just so that I could have enough pieces to last me the entire bowl but I felt for $15 that I paid, I could have gotten more than three pieces of steak. The rice and beans had no real flavor at all. It did come with a side sauce, but that didn't really make any flavor pop out. I also added hot sauce but still didn't make a difference. Too me, it was just very bland and nothing spectacular. The truffle fries, though, wrote delicious. I think I enjoyed those most than the bowl itself. I wished they were a bit more crispier, but after a no flavorful dish, I felt like that truffle flavor really made it for me. I also got their cranberry mimosa, which was delicious. Never go bad with a mimosa. I'm not sure if I will come again. With the hassle of parking and bland flavor, it wouldn't be a place I would go out of my way to come back. If I happen too, I may try something different.  Overall, the employees were super nice and a very clean, organized location."

            "review_text": "VERY POORLY MANAGED!\n\nA group of our friends made a reservation for brunch at 1pm on a Saturday. When we arrived we could barely walk in the door the line was so long to even get to the host stand. There are employees everywhere, multiple people standing around behind the cash registers on the grocery side, multiple people running TO-GO food up to the horribly placed pickup station... but somehow the host, who apparently was the manager, was the only one checking guests in and seating them.\n\nOut of the 10-15 tables in the restaurant, there was only maybe 4-5 seated with guests. The rest of the tables were littered with dirty dishes. And no one seemed to care to buss and clean them.\n\nAfter waiting well over an hour in the line to get checked in... we finally got to the host stand to check in, only to be told multiple excuses, and that \"their kitchen was overrun, and that they may not be able to accommodate our reservation!\". This was very frustrating to hear due to the fact there were only few tables seated at the moment and most already had their food.\n\nWe did think about going somewhere else, but because we had friends from out of town and had already made reservations, and we heard good things about the food, we decided to try and wait.\n\nFinally we were seated 45 minutes after our reservation time, and by this point the restaurant was half full. We were served still tap water which was so dirty that it appeared to be sparkling water, with chunks of dirt floating in the bottle. We were still surrounded by dirty empty tables and the bar top was literally covered in unwashed dirty glasses.\n\nOur server was nice, and trying to accommodate us. The food and drinks were decent. So there are no complaints there.\n\nThis restaurant is a great idea, and the food and drinks were great... but it goes without saying that the management needs to step up and provide better customer service, and focus as much energy as they have on the decor, into realigning their staff to be able to handle and adequately servicing their guests in in a crowded south end location."

After a full 45 minutes, not everyone had received their drinks and we hadn't even ordered food. We ended up leaving and heading to a restaurant across the street which accommodated us and gave us great service.\n\nI have eaten brunch at the Salted Melon before and their food is quite good.

These are some great sandwiches. I think the panini was my favorite, but I loved both. The couscous salad may have been my single favorite item we got.\n\nMy only small complaint is that their sandwiches come with a boring salad as the side dish. You have to pay a decent amount extra to upgrade to better sides. I wish their default side was something better than a salad.\n\nI'd love to come back for dinner and try their full sit-down menu!"

This time, I didn't want to risk something not being available via the app, so I ordered at the counter. I got the steak sandwich to go. The steak itself was okay but the toppings and bread really made the sandwich. Overall, a tasty meal."

They left the sweet potatoes off of my That's How I Bowl. A waiter came up and I asked for a box and I never saw him again.

On top of that, the bread was so old and stale, I'm lucky I didn't chip a tooth. Overall, you could simply tell that the employees don't care about the customer or the quality of their food.

Honestly we wanted to go to Barcelona but the wait was too long. Seeing as this was new and seemed mostly empty we decided to give it a shot.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and updated which is good seeing as it is new. My wife and I were seated after the bartender had to go find the hostess so it was about a 3-4 min wait with a restaurant that was about 20% full.\n\nThe menu seemed promising and had a few options that appeared to be worth sharing.  We went for the GLOBE TROTTER and Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Bruschetta, a drink from the bar and 2 sodas for a total of around $50 if I remember correctly.\n\nThe Globe Trotter was mixed...some bites seemed to be good while others not so much not sure why.  The half my wife took was loaded with jalapenos while mine had 2.  The Brushetta was amazing and I would highly recommend it.  Our server Ammar was great and very attentive to our needs.\n\nThe other pain point here is that if you park in the parking garage that is adjacent to this restaurant they DO NOT VALIDATE PARKING.  At the time of this writing parking is $4.00 every 30 min.  So our bill for parking was $10.  So a meal for two with tip and parking was roughly $70 for a shared meal.\n\nAll in all we didn't love it!  We might try it again in the future like for brunch but it's not one to add to our must go back to list."

The whole concept of a convenient store is mode along with a restaurant .\n\nOur food was beyond basic we both decided to play it safe only because when we ordered our drinks we were not wowed by the drinks alone . Now I myself am a lover of aperol spritz cocktails, I noticed they offered the slushy aperol spritzer which I thought would be really cool but they actually tasted nothing like an aperol spritz at all . I ordered a Turkey burger and my friend ordered a chicken dish that she wasn't even aware was a type of burger Because it did not state burger on the menu ! Neither of us was crazy about our food I literally took a few bites and couldn't eat anymore I ate all of my fries tho . When our waiter came he asked did we want to go boxes and when we said no I could tell his facial expression said it all like ok they apparently did not care for their food which was obvious being that either of us barley ate our food .\n\nSo our totals each was a little over $30 each .

Sat at the high top tables just behind the bar seats for cocktails, and not only was it super loud (lots of hard surfaces, and no sound absorption panels to be seen), but it was so hot inside. We were served cocktails that were warm... like the server told us that the bartender didn't know if we wanted our drinks cold, so they were room temperature. Despite ordering a stirred gin martini and peach mojito - who knew we needed to say iced??? Eventually our server came back and we asked for ice, only to receive 15 mins after we got our drinks. We watched the bartender making drinks, who wasn't using mixing containers and ice to chill the cocktails, but instead just making every cocktail straight in the glass it was served in. No one wants a warm cocktail, I can promise you that. Underwhelming and far better options in Southend."

I was hoping the rest of it would be good, but it was very dull and hardly any flavor.

I will raise my review if I notice progress in the coming months. I don't want people to waste their money ordering what I did, so maybe my review will help people have a better experience.I do know they are a new restaurant, so I am trying to keep that in mind.\n\nMain take away- don't order a sandwich from here"

The grocery section had a very nice selection to choose from definitely were to get a sandwich/drink/snack for lunch. Theres also a bakery counter in the grocery side. Lots of seating for a casual lunch time or for waiting on your to go order. Theres a parking garage in the building if you cannot find free parking on the nearby streets. The kinks to still work out; bread was a bit chewy/over toasted. The bartenders are new and the drinks needed to be stirred, but otherwise proportions of drink mix to alcohol was correct. Some of the veggies in the grocery section were starting to whither/wrinkle. They don't have shades on the windows yet but they're on order to be installed asap. These are all minor issues that will be resolved soon I'm sure.\n\nAbsolutely grab a bite and go grocery shopping at the Salted Melon!"
