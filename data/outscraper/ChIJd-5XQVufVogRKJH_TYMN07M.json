She was incredibly knowledgeable about their menu, took great pride in her offerings and was BEYOND kind!\n\nI'm a coffee snob and I only like espresso either hot or iced and/or cold brew. I don't like Americanos, lattes, etc HOWEVER on our way to the shop I had read reviews about the rosemary latte and I LOVE rosemary so I was curious especially when I saw it on the menu. Emily was so enthusiastic about the latte that I went WAY out of my comfort zone to try one and WOWOWOW!!! I asked her how she liked it and she said iced and also advised that she puts the smoked salt on top so I took her suggestion except I opted for oat milk. The latte was PHENOMENAL!\n\nOur whole experience was great and we definitely can't wait to come back! Despite us coming within an hour of closing time she didn't mind using her ceramic and glass for our drinks (my husband had a cappuccino that he said was very comparable to his favorite cappuccino ever) which may seem like not a big deal to most but sadly most places we go to either only have paper/plastic cups or if they do have ceramic they tell us WITH NO SHAME that it's almost closing time in a way that we're inconveniencing them by making them wash an extra dish...so annoying \n\nWe will definitely be back very soon!!!"

Honorable considering there is no shortage of coffee shops here in Charlotte. I had the pecan pie latte with almond milk instead of the standard whole milk and a side of the sourdough that comes salted and with butter. Absolutely amazing! I scarfed the majority of it down in the car lol! There is on site parking here for those who have parking anxiety like me! There is also free street parking nearby as well. If you're following gps, turn in when you see Penn Station. Stable Hand is in this plaza. They also have wine and beers (both canned and draft!) I didn't get the chance to try it out today but I will definitely be back another day! Thank you Stable Hand and thank you Offline for having this place as a one of the monthly rewards for November. Excellent choice!"

Nice taste and texture. Not lumpy at all. I enjoyed it.\nThe service is good too.\nThe food was ok. Very cute presentation. I has the Avo Tart. It was too pricey, in my opinion. The avocado wasn't very flavorful. There was a bit too much of this hot oil on it. I added and egg. They call it soft egg and say the egg white is cooked, but it isn't. It was an almost completely raw egg, which some people may like, but I like the egg white better done.\nThey did change it and offered a scrambled egg instead, which was cooked in a funny way. Although it was a scrambled egg. This was $10.85.\nI still enjoyed the drink very much. Thank you."

The biscuit: this biscuit is buttery, soft and flakey all at the same time... that's the most you can ask from a biscuit\n2. Frosting: this frosting was very sweet but somehow light, not overly thick, it pairs perfectly with the buttery biscuit\n3. Strawberry and basil: you never really think of basil in a sweet biscuit but the two together taste fantastic... I wish I could have had two..."

The hot oat latte we had may as well have been iced, it was the most Luke warm coffee I've ever had\n\nOverall, it's great espresso, but that comes more down to the roaster than to anything else.

They even having evening food, alcohol and a gorgeous collection of bottles of wine, many of which are natural wines. Don't let the small size of the shop and menu scare you- everything is delicious. The savory rice porridge bowl may be my new favorite breakfast item in the city."

Indeed, this place has great coffee, good beer selection and very interesting food menu.  I enjoyed sitting at a coffeeshop again after 3 months or so of not visiting one.
