The atmosphere was also simply perfect. The live plants inside, colorful yet chic and sophisticated, and the sort of indie alternative coffee shop music was on point.

On a Friday morning, quite peaceful as I enjoyed my second coffee of the day.\n\nI love coffee shops that have a cortado on the menu. It tells me that they're not one of those button pushing baristas like at the Green Siren people. No, this is real coffee and real art. Served in the proper short glass, this coffee was excellent.\n\nSitting with my laptop and able to pound out a few emails and maybe even a Yelp review, this was a great little space for working. A very enjoyable morning indeed."

I also got an avocado toast and a blueberry muffin. The avocado toast was a work of art and the egg was poached perfectly. Everything was balanced well and there was a nice little kick from the hot sauce that was drizzled on top. The blueberry muffin was moist, and they had other baked goods that looked amazing too. There was a consistent stream of customers cycling through so it definitely seems like a recognized spot in the neighborhood."

Honorable considering there is no shortage of coffee shops here in Charlotte. I had the pecan pie latte with almond milk instead of the standard whole milk and a side of the sourdough that comes salted and with butter. Absolutely amazing! I scarfed the majority of it down in the car lol! There is on site parking here for those who have parking anxiety like me! There is also free street parking nearby as well. If you're following gps, turn in when you see Penn Station. Stable Hand is in this plaza. They also have wine and beers (both canned and draft!) I didn't get the chance to try it out today but I will definitely be back another day! Thank you Stable Hand and thank you Offline for having this place as a one of the monthly rewards for November. Excellent choice!"

Nice taste and texture. Not lumpy at all. I enjoyed it.\nThe service is good too.\nThe food was ok. Very cute presentation. I has the Avo Tart. It was too pricey, in my opinion. The avocado wasn't very flavorful. There was a bit too much of this hot oil on it. I added and egg. They call it soft egg and say the egg white is cooked, but it isn't. It was an almost completely raw egg, which some people may like, but I like the egg white better done.\nThey did change it and offered a scrambled egg instead, which was cooked in a funny way. Although it was a scrambled egg. This was $10.85.\nI still enjoyed the drink very much. Thank you."

The biscuit: this biscuit is buttery, soft and flakey all at the same time... that's the most you can ask from a biscuit\n2. Frosting: this frosting was very sweet but somehow light, not overly thick, it pairs perfectly with the buttery biscuit\n3. Strawberry and basil: you never really think of basil in a sweet biscuit but the two together taste fantastic... I wish I could have had two..."

The hot oat latte we had may as well have been iced, it was the most Luke warm coffee I've ever had\n\nOverall, it's great espresso, but that comes more down to the roaster than to anything else.

I've been to over 20 coffee shops in Charlotte and this is in my top three. The food and drink have been made with a thoughtfulness and quality that really can't be compared to anywhere else in town. They even having evening food, alcohol and a gorgeous collection of bottles of wine, many of which are natural wines. Don't let the small size of the shop and menu scare you- everything is delicious. The savory rice porridge bowl may be my new favorite breakfast item in the city."

Indeed, this place has great coffee, good beer selection and very interesting food menu.  I enjoyed sitting at a coffeeshop again after 3 months or so of not visiting one.
