From its breathtaking scenery to its history that dates back to the beginning of man. Yemen is the homeland of our family. As first-generation immigrants, we wanted to honor our heritage. Yemen is where coffee was invented and later flourished in global trade. Roasting and serving coffee is something that is inclusive of all people and cultures, and brings people together. Our coffee is grown from altitudes over 3,000 ft in a mountainous village called Haraz, where our namesake originates.",

I first tried it in Dearborn, where it's originally from, and I was in love with the shop there, and now this one is at the same level. The atmosphere is great, although the shop is small it's decorated beautifully and emphasizes the culture and beauty of Yemen. The traditional qawah and chai serving cups are such a special touch. This is unlike any coffee shop you'll go to. They have some of the best espresso I've had, and then paired with the different spices just makes it perfection. The pistachio latte... yall. They get it right EVERY time  I can say that I'm addicted, it's just tooo yummy. Now if you're not a coffee person, the adeni chai??? So creamy and spiced to perfection. I need to know what those spices are because how do they balance so well The Khaliat Nahl is so good and the soft bread paired with the creamy filling is divine. It's perfect paired with a nice cup of coffee. This is definitely a must try when you have the opportunity."

To my surprise, the manager, who had a piercing on her under lip, first requested an additional charge for the extra milk instead of inquiring why I needed it. Her approach felt unpolite and lacked understanding.\n\nI chose not to ask for a replacement matcha, which might have been a more appropriate request given my dissatisfaction with the drink's initial taste. I simply wanted to make my drink more enjoyable by adding more milk.\n\nWhile I appreciate the quality and consistency of Haraz Coffee Shop's offerings, this experience was somewhat disappointing. I hope in the future, the staff considers customer satisfaction as a priority, especially when the request is as simple as adding a bit more milk to balance out a strong drink."

At times, it felt there were as many people \"working\" behind the bar as there were standing on our side of the register.  What were they doing?

Making people wait over 20 minutes for items that are already ready to go and simply need to be bagged and handed to the customer is ridiculous. You have people who have to wait for things like coffee or items that need to be prepared but why make someone wait for a ready made item that is literally sitting right next to the cashier. She could have handed it to me in the time it took for my card to process at the register. That was so ridiculous and time consuming. It's like 19 workers behind the register the place is already small so the fact that the waiting line for people who are just grabbing a ready pastry is as long as the foods that need prep is crazy. Also the taste of the item I purchased simply wasn't fresh and the taste wasn't good."

Yes... the things they make and do are pretty. The pastries are pretty. The copper cups for the Turkish coffee are pretty... as are other items they sell. All of this makes for nice pictures. The middle eastern theme is novel for the area, too. I just didn't enjoy anything I ate or drank.... This was the most atypical Turkish coffee I've ever had... watery, weak, light, uninteresting.... All my other Turkish coffee experiences were dark, strong and robust, including the traditional fine grounds at the bottom of the cup. I didn't like the food either... something was just a bit strange with all that I tried.... Including the pastry flake being soggy, not crisp.\n\nTo me, this is where you go to take pictures and pretend you're having a great time...and perhaps pretend you're being multi-cultural. If you truly enjoy good coffee, there are better options around with fewer frills."

The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star was the service which was not aligned with Middle eastern hospitality. The person who took the order and the servers didn't seem friendly & welcoming. That's something which can definitely add to the whole experience."

I have a severe nut allergy, and if I hadn't looked closely at the mosaic cake before eating, I would be in the hospital right now. I had gotten the pistachio mosaic cake, and even my presumably butter croissant was wrong, and an almond croissant stared back at me. So not only did they charge me a lot, they gave me two things I could not eat. If I could give them 0 stars I would. Cute cafe tho"

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, perfect for enjoying their unique coffee offerings and exquisite desserts.\n\nWe ordered a Turkish coffee and an Iced Harazi Coffee, along with a selection of desserts including a pistachio mosaic Turkish cake, saffron milk cake, and berry milk cake. The Turkish coffee was authentic and rich, just as you'd expect, served with a traditional touch.\n\nThe Iced Harazi Coffee was a new experience for me. The barista mentioned it was stronger than regular iced coffee with espresso, but I found it surprisingly lighter and very refreshing. Although it wasn't as strong as I anticipated, the flavor was exceptional and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe desserts were a highlight too. Each cake was beautifully presented and tasted as good as they looked. The pistachio mosaic Turkish cake was delightfully nutty, the saffron milk cake was subtly flavored and perfectly sweet, and the berry milk cake was wonderfully light and fruity.\n\nAdditionally, the branding and style of the location added to the overall experience. The chic to-go cups, gold utensils, and trendy black plates showcased their attention to detail and enhanced the stylish ambiance.\n\nHaraz Coffee House is a gem for anyone who loves coffee and sweets. The service is excellent, with attentive and knowledgeable staff. I highly recommend a visit for a truly enjoyable coffee experience!"

The pastries looked amazing and was hard to choose one or two. We went for the most popular (strawberry croissant $6.50) and the Biscoff cheesecake $8. They both looked delicious but tasted 2/10. First of all, I dont think the croissant is actual croissant dough as it was not flaky and had the consistency of a normal bread, more like a Brioche. The Biscoff tasted better but still lacked so much flavor!\nAnother thing is that the place has probably 5 comfortable places to sit, the rest are regular wooden chairs, but almost everything was taken over by students who had probably been there for hours. So one goes to enjoy the atmosphere, and the place is beautifully decorated, but you are left with no choice and have to sit in the uncomfortable chairs or take it to go.\nNow, customer service, was terrible. The girl that took our order was nice but knew little about their products. They probably had 6 people behind the counter just chatting and flirting with each other and left us, the customers, the job of cleaning tables in order to be able to sit there to enjoy our purchase\nThis place needs to improve so much in management and train their employees, and im very sure they dont need so many employees who are not doing anything, really. But Im sad to say I would not be back here, or recommend it to friends. Lots of room to improve!"

I was looking forward to drinking in a glass mug/cup, so a bit disappointed with the experience. The coffee had a beautiful cardamom aroma, slight froth and minimal sweetness. It tasted delicious if you like strong, not so sweet coffee.  It was not bitter at all.\n\nThe croissant itself was dry and stale. The pistachio cream was subtle in flavor and nice and the crunchy pistachio crust was also nice. Unfortunately the round croissant missed the mark for me.\n\nI am usually hesitant to order pastries at the end of the day, however, because of Ramadan, I assumed they were freshly baked because sunset was fast approaching.\n\nNext time I will try pastries earlier in the day and also from their traditional menu (Bee Bites or Mosaic cake)."

If you need a place to study/rest/work, do not come here (extremely crowded and loud -  could not get a table). I was told their traffic is like that all day. I ordered a white mocha, and my Dad ordered a mocha. It took at least 30 minutes of us standing there from start to finish from ordering to holding our drinks. This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry. I did not sense the employees cared about how long it took, and they had plenty of staff behind the bar. Positives: the pastries are delicious, the theme makes you feel like you're in Turkey, their products have an outstandingly beautiful execution, and it's brand new. Negatives: they automatically put cardamom or some other spice into the coffee even when it is not mentioned on the menu. It gave me a headache and my Dad didn't care for it either, so we both poured half of our drinks down the drain. This place is expensive. 2 coffees and 2 pastries was $28.00. If you're adventurous, have an exotic palate that is open to everything, and if you'd like an experience, this is place to go. You pay for the experience. Kind of like Disney. I'm glad I tried it, but will not be back."

We got a small pot of the Harazi Mufawar and it was plenty for 2 people. Lots of unique desserts - the milk cake was really good (similar to tres leches). The pistachio croissant and chocolate turkish cake were decent but nothing I'd need to eat again. They didn't have the bee bites which are one of of their most popular items.\n\nThe con is the lack of space. This is not a good place for groups of more than 2. We showed up at 11am on a Saturday and stood in a line out the door for quite a while and weren't sitting down with our food until about 45 minutes later. It's not due to being under-staffed, as they have plenty of people on the line working. Things take a while to make and people don't move through tables quickly if they're drinking a whole pot of coffee. So all in all, yes I would come back but probably in the evening when it's quieter. Also the ambiance is nothing super special.\n*parking lot is behind the building and there is a small seating area in the back!"

I felt bad watching someone sit on a window (which is clearly not meant for seating bc it's a narrow window sill) reading a book with her coffee on her lap while I waited for my order next to her because there weren't any seats available and it was raining outside. This place has potential!! Food is great. Cmon Haraz! We want to support you and come back!"

Every taste demonstrates their med roast coffee beans that actually come from Yemen. You won't be let down whether you want a traditional, an espresso, a smoothie,a latte. Even a refresher they have it all and with perfection and a smile on their faces, the baristas create every drink with LOVE ! Beyond only coffee, there's a delicious array of pastries to choose from. ( I recommend the bee bites and the round croissants ) They always have freshly made pastries every morning , they make for a perfect pairing with your coffee of choice.\nHowever, Haraz's outstanding customer service is what really makes it stand out. The staff is eager to make your stay unforgettable, they were really nice and hilarious. Their passion for what they do is outstanding . This is the place to be whether you're looking for a peaceful spot to work, meet up with friends, or simply to enjoy a delicious cup of coffee.

            "review_text": "Let's talk about this 5 star coffee and tea shop!!\n\nPrior to visiting for the week my sister insisted that I try out the new kid on the block called Haraz Coffee house. She told me it was not far from my parents home so it was a no brainer that I was going to check it out.\n\nFollowing church service on Sunday my mom and I stopped by. We were fortunate enough  to find parking. However, please note it is limited. There is a small lot behind the shop as well as a few spots on the side of the building. Walking up there was a decent line outside and  down the side walk. I would NOT recommend coming on a Sunday if you are in a rush. I am fairly  certain it took me about 45 minutes to get a drink!\n\nThis spot is small. There is limited seating so most will likely be getting orders to go. However, note that there are additional seats towards the rear of the shop. You can also enter and exit at the back.\n\nI ordered the saffron latte with oat milk and only half  the sugar  ( a tablespoon is the standard amount). I also opted to try a plain croissant since the pistachio was already sold out.  They take your name when you place  your order and call it out when your order is ready.  Since they are crazy busy right now it can get a little hectic towards the back area where you wait for your order.  I also  purchased a bag of the chai tea it was $30 but appears to be enough for a decent amount of drinks. I can't  wait to try it!\n\nThe saffron tea was amazing! It is a different taste, more earthy, but it is my vibe. I honestly think I would  enjoy it with no sugar. The croissant was perfect--- light, buttery and oh so tasty!\n\nSoooo- I enjoyed my experience so much that my mom and I returned today to meet my sister! This time my mom ordered the saffron tea and we substituted sugar for honey. I ordered the pistachio latte  with the honey sub too. Both of our drinks were made with oat milk. We split an almond croissant today!  We  were  able to enjoy our treats as dine in customers today!  The drinks and croissant did not disappoint. My order today came up to about $23 for two drinks and a croissant\n\nI LOVE this spot!  If you are a tea and/or coffee drinker I highly recommend checking this spot out! They are open from 6am to 11pm Monday to  Friday and 7am   To 11pm on Saturday and Sunday. In addition to the amazing drinks they offer  a number  of pastries that look amazing! This would make for a great after dinner spot  for dessert!\n\nI hope you check it out and fall in love with it as much as I did!"

Major brownie points due to them being open 7 days a week until 11pm which is unheard of here . Every time now I visit it's jam packed so I suggest arriving early or mid day when it slows down .\n\nMy top favorites here you have to try the salted caramel latte & bee bites ! Others also love the pistachio & saffron latte . I honestly believe you can't go wrong with anything you choose here . Now they offer mostly sweets & desserts so I'll be glad when & if they add actual breakfast sandwiches to the mix !\n\nMake your way to this one of a kind specialty coffee shop & go catch all the Arabian vibes inside !"

These folks were knocking orders out!\n\nWe decided on the pot of Saudi coffee & several pastries. I can't say no to croissants plain and with almonds.\n\nMy husband & son went with a chocolate sprinkled generously with pistachios. Everything was  perfect!\n\nAs a girl who grew up with a mom & relatives from Iraq, Turkish coffee was common but this visit to Haraz, was a unique experience for myself, my son and husband.\n\nIf you are looking for a table, you may struggle to find a seat on the weekend. Perhaps a weekday may work better for others.\n\nSave this place on Google Maps & come see for yourself why Haraz has become the place to be in Charlotte's coffee scene."

I greeted everyone (no customers besides me so this was to those working) with a hearty GOOD MORNING! The energy wasn't reciprocated so I considered cultural differences but expected more warmth and welcoming vibes. I received none. I ordered an almond croissant (very tasty but I've had better), the pitch cream cake (it was okay, definitely not compelled to order again), and the Saudi (which I asked about prior  and was dryly responded to)... I wish I hadn't ordered. It's my understanding that they're still fairly new. Regardless for what I expected to be a unique experience...they may consider asking customers \"is it your first time?\" Making suggestions asking customers what they want...some type of engagement but there was NONE which was disappointing and although they weren't overtly rude they were in no form or fashion nice either. Aesthetically I found it refreshing and modern with hints of traditional elements but nothing made me feel welcome or like I need to go back. Just for the purpose of providing contrast... BACKYARD BREW...walks you through and engages in a way that gives you not only a sense of what you want based on what they offer they give  you an experience that makes you want to return for more. I guess Hazar is about what you want and/or need from your coffee experience. Some may love it but my experience this morning was subpar at best. I plan to return a different time of day to see if me coming so early is why the staff was void of any good vibes. But if they're not ready to GO in every way by 7...they shouldn't open at 7 OR say \"we are still prepping this morning but your experience is important to us so don't hesitate...blah blah \" customer service though is not even a goal or mission for most places and many consumers just take anything. Not I "

No one ever said hello or spoke or anything. It was around 6-7 pm on a Thursday and the place was moderately full but not insanely busy for me to go unnoticed. I decided to just sit and read my book but then out of nowhere, they decided to blast the music. Everyone then had to talk louder to hear over the music thus ruining my ability to enjoy my book. I left. Outside of that pastries did look pretty good. Hopefully I'll get to try it if I end up moving to Charlotte."

Items were selling fast but I got to try the iced Haraz latte, saffron milk cake, and pistachio croissant. The coffee was rich and a smooth flavor which I haven't had before. The saffron cake was not too sweet and delicious with a beautiful presentation. Then the croissant cake was a great treat that would be best served with a hot drink. I really enjoyed my experience and where opening is a dash, the service was still warm and personal while providing great drinks and treats. I can't wait to come back."

The service is fantastic, everyone is extraordinarily attentive,  helpful and pleasant.  Even the patrons are good natured.  The coffee itself is fantastic! We've tried 5 different coffees on the menu and 3 desserts.  All superb.  And the hours....what a wonderful thing it is to have a local coffee shop that is open late!!  Need I say more.  :)"

A gentleman working said that the croissants were a little smaller than usual so he gave me two!\n\nThe croissant was very tasty and they said nothing was in the middle but I think it had a little bit of almond cream in it.  It wasn't too sweet just right!!\nThis is an example of a wonderful Middle Eastern coffee place!  The place was packed with people socializing and there's more tables in the back!\n\nI would recommend stopping here for coffee and a pastry!  I look forward to trying more of their items.  I will say due to it being a more specialized coffee place the prices are reflective of that.\nMy total was $16.64 which included $1.50 tip.\nNot an everyday coffee place for me cost wise but was worth the price!"

Tasted it and didn't like it.\n\nThe manager attempted to be helpful but made things worst by trying to explain the \"logic\" but still didn't any sense or resolved the issue because again I had to pay another 8-9 dollars for drink instead of exchanging it out.\n\nI can't believe how terrible this experience has been and sitting here in this establishment after having  traveled across we the country again from LA to get this treatment.... I don't recommend coming here at all for coffee.\n\nOne the plus side the coffee shop is cute but again what's cute with terrible service and experience!!!\n\nFollowing us leaving: Manager is sitting outside and has the never and audacity to continue this conversation about how my experience was making this worst because he clearly had a miss understanding along with making things worst, dismissed me trying to educate him on how to treat people. His excuses and response was he \"wasn't from here\" I responded I wasn't either. In all regardless where you are from....RESPECT IS UNIVERSAL!\n\nAgain Terrible experience. To top it off. He told me he would refund my moment after attempting to hand me $3 in cash after I'd spend over $25 on the first order and $9 on the second.... $3 dollars. Very insulting! Waited outside for what... to make matters worse!"

You should treat your customers equally but anyway. My wife got mad and told me to come back inside with her and they finally took my order.

Seats were pretty comfortable, and there is also a back space which was quieter.\nFour star because the speed of coffee making seems not very efficient. Tea was served pretty fast, but the two barista who were making coffee seemed a bit slow. Also, we had two pistachio latte and one was sweeter than the other.\nPerhaps not for people who want to grab a quick drink and run, but worth make a stop and enjoy something from the menu."
