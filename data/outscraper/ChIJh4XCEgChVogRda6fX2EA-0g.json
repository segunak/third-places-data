From its breathtaking scenery to its history that dates back to the beginning of man. Yemen is the homeland of our family. As first-generation immigrants, we wanted to honor our heritage. Yemen is where coffee was invented and later flourished in global trade. Roasting and serving coffee is something that is inclusive of all people and cultures, and brings people together. Our coffee is grown from altitudes over 3,000 ft in a mountainous village called Haraz, where our namesake originates.",

I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nTheir plain Latte was outstanding. No sort of bitter aftertaste at all. it really did have hint of chocolate taste to it. Their Bee Bite bread was also outstanding. Imagine a really soft Challah bread but stuffed with a mildly sweet cream cheese. They give you honey with it but I hate honey. It's great by itself.\n\nService was professional, efficient, and very quick. The interior is super clean with alot of seating. My only ding is the small complicated to get into parking lot. You can enter the cafe from a back door from the lot or a front door on the main street.\n\nI want to go back to try more things."

I asked her about an item and she just rang it up without saying what it was.  I gave my order and paid while she bagged it.  I asked her about one of the refresher drinks. She explained it curtly and seemed bothered.  It was busy but everyone was seated and had already ordered, there was no line.  Overall, not a good experience.  I ordered some sort of saffron soaked knafeh \"cheesecake\".  I only know that from when she rang it up.  Plus, the pistachio croissant filled with pistachio cream.  None of this is sweet.  The \"cheesecake\" is straight cream cheese.  I'm not sure how to eat it, it comes with a syrup.  The pistachio croissant is salty and nutty not a single hint of sweetness.  I'm not mad about it.  It just isn't to my taste.  Everything in the case looked pretty but is very unexpected.  I'm glad I at least tried it but I will not be back."

This Haraz is very nice looking but the vibe is of just a regular cafe. Completely lost its Yemeni cafe vibe. We will stick to Qahwah down the road and I recommend you do as well.\n\nEDIT: as we were leaving the server, came to clean up our drinks and realized they were still full and asked if there was something wrong. I said \"yes they taste like straight up milk as if it barely has any espresso.\" All she said was \"sorry about that\"  grabbed them and walked away."

I ordered a Pistachio latte with an additional espresso shot. This was the best Pistachio latte that I have ever had. My daughter ordered a mango smoothie. For pastries and other treats (some were to go)we ordered the strawberry brioche roll, pistachio brioche roll, pistachio milk cake, dulche de leche milk cake and a Dubai chocolate bar which totaled $58.00. The  rolls were delicious but a lot to eat so I had to break mine up into separate parts of the day and it held up well. We have not tried the cakes yet. The place is aesthetically pleasing, service is pretty swift for as busy as they are and the gentleman that  packed our order was very pleasant. We ordered to go because it was super busy. We arrived around 10:20 am and there were no seats. As we picked up our order and was heading out of the door, a table opened and I was able to get some work done while my daughter watched Netflix. Parking was a breeze as I accidentally passed the location but ran into an empty parking lot that took a minute to walk to Haraz. As others have mentioned, if wanting a seat, then you must arrive early, it is busy and lots of buzz so not super work friendly but I placed my earbuds in and got some work done while I sipped.  We will definitely return. I can't say it will be very regular as I live in Fort Mill but a nice treat here and there. I wish they would open a location in South Charlotte."

I really wanted to try to Bee Bites, but I came back again months later and finally ordered it. I tried the savory one.\n\nI also like that there's a good amount of seating inside and the interior is so sleek."

I was disappointed that they did not have any round croissants or chocolate ones and I came at 6:30pm on a Wednesday. The croissant in the photo was a little overcooked and I requested a new one and the cashier very graciously cooked it perfectly for me the second time. The workers clean your plate off the table for you with a smile. Very nice.  I will be returning."

When I tried to clarify further, she curtly said \"no\" in a tone that felt unnecessarily rude and dismissive.\n\nThe desserts were average, the cortado (and presumably the espresso overall) was subpar, and the Turkish coffee was flavored with cardamom, which deviates from traditional Turkish coffee. The music selection--Arabic tunes--was decent but felt a bit too loud for a cafe setting.\n\nUltimately, the unprofessional attitude of the staff overshadowed everything else and left us with a sour impression."

It's loud and busy which is so comforting when you want to hang out and not necessarily just work. If you're looking for a working vibe, this is probably not the spot for you.\n\nHere we've seen tons of friends hanging out, playing cards, laughing and having such a good time.\n\nAnd the food/coffee is amazingggg. I've had a few sweet treats including the Biscoff cheesecake which was so delicous (highly recommend). I've also had a iced salted caramel macchiato which was tasty and the presentation was even cooler.\n\nThe service is pretty fast and efficient, especially for how busy they get.\n\nIf you haven't experienced Haraz, go try it out TODAY (or tomorrow lol)."

The staff and owners, especially Hamed and Saeed, went above and beyond to make my visit exciting and memorable. Their warmth and dedication to customer satisfaction are truly commendable.\nHaraz Coffee is also a fantastic spot for anyone looking to work or study. The quiet area is perfect for getting things done, and the friendly, soulful environment makes it a pleasure to spend time here. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place and will definitely be recommending it to everyone I know."

The Harazi iced coffee has no coffee taste, just unpleasant cardamum. The pistachio latte had a strange taste, mostly just sweetness with no flavor outside of mild pistachio. The pastry again was sub-par, not at all worth the cost. The main issue I have is the prices. $35 for two coffees and two pastries with tip seems very high. Receipt attached.\n\n--\n\nCappuccino was really nice. Overall nicely decorated location with well-presented products. Efficient staff. Croissant tasted like chemicals and freezer, though, and was tough-textured. Strawberry Brioche was decent but nothing to write home about.\n\nI'd like to try more of their drinks, but I'm not so interested in the pastry anymore."

The atmosphere is great, although the shop is small it's decorated beautifully and emphasizes the culture and beauty of Yemen. The traditional qawah and chai serving cups are such a special touch. This is unlike any coffee shop you'll go to. They have some of the best espresso I've had, and then paired with the different spices just makes it perfection. The pistachio latte... yall. They get it right EVERY time  I can say that I'm addicted, it's just tooo yummy. Now if you're not a coffee person, the adeni chai??? So creamy and spiced to perfection. I need to know what those spices are because how do they balance so well The Khaliat Nahl is so good and the soft bread paired with the creamy filling is divine. It's perfect paired with a nice cup of coffee. This is definitely a must try when you have the opportunity."

To my surprise, the manager, who had a piercing on her under lip, first requested an additional charge for the extra milk instead of inquiring why I needed it. Her approach felt unpolite and lacked understanding.\n\nI chose not to ask for a replacement matcha, which might have been a more appropriate request given my dissatisfaction with the drink's initial taste. I simply wanted to make my drink more enjoyable by adding more milk.\n\nWhile I appreciate the quality and consistency of Haraz Coffee Shop's offerings, this experience was somewhat disappointing. I hope in the future, the staff considers customer satisfaction as a priority, especially when the request is as simple as adding a bit more milk to balance out a strong drink."

And I waited about half an hour to get it.  I've also seen two baristas move through a line of 30-40 people with much more efficiency.  At times, it felt there were as many people \"working\" behind the bar as there were standing on our side of the register.  What were they doing?  I opted out of a pastry because they looked like a far cry from anything that could be made fresh in house.  I just don't get the hype."

Making people wait over 20 minutes for items that are already ready to go and simply need to be bagged and handed to the customer is ridiculous. You have people who have to wait for things like coffee or items that need to be prepared but why make someone wait for a ready made item that is literally sitting right next to the cashier. She could have handed it to me in the time it took for my card to process at the register. That was so ridiculous and time consuming. It's like 19 workers behind the register the place is already small so the fact that the waiting line for people who are just grabbing a ready pastry is as long as the foods that need prep is crazy. Also the taste of the item I purchased simply wasn't fresh and the taste wasn't good."

Yes... the things they make and do are pretty. The pastries are pretty. The copper cups for the Turkish coffee are pretty... as are other items they sell. All of this makes for nice pictures. The middle eastern theme is novel for the area, too. I just didn't enjoy anything I ate or drank.... This was the most atypical Turkish coffee I've ever had... watery, weak, light, uninteresting.... All my other Turkish coffee experiences were dark, strong and robust, including the traditional fine grounds at the bottom of the cup. I didn't like the food either... something was just a bit strange with all that I tried.... Including the pastry flake being soggy, not crisp.\n\nTo me, this is where you go to take pictures and pretend you're having a great time...and perhaps pretend you're being multi-cultural. If you truly enjoy good coffee, there are better options around with fewer frills."
