Not the same machines that you basically see in airline lounges that are self serve.\n\nWas in town on a work trip and stopped by with a group.  I asked for a cortado or espresso macchiato. The cashier looked confused and after a moment told me they only have \"push button machines\" and can't make one.\n\nFine.....I'll do it myself I thought.  I ordered a small cappuccino, planned to just pour the excess milk out and when I opened the lid to the drink, it was so full of milk that it made a mess all over the cup due to being filled all the way to the top.\n\nEven after pouring out half of the cup the drink was still not good at all.  Just tasted like hot milk with with a hint of coffee.\n\nSo overall,  if you aren't into pre-made drinks from a push button machine consider another establishment.  I can't say I would return."

The interior of the coffee shop is decorated very modern and cozy. While business is busy, the environment is still pretty conducive to productivity and it's not too loud. Also, can't forget, the employees are so kind! Highly recommend."
