We learned some of the history about how the brewery began and plans for future expansion. Our food was delicious. Sodas are served only in bottles because the owner feels they are more all natural ingredients. Beers are brewed off site, but served draft style from kegs. Well drinks and wines are also available. Coffee comes from the Coffee Shop attached to the restaurant. Coffee is brewed from HEX Coffee, a local business. Restrooms are actually individual stalls, in keeping with the Suffolk horse theme. Bar stools and chairs are comfy leather, also keeping with the equestrian theme. There are ample indoor and outdoor seating areas. Outdoor seating is in an all-season decor setting. This place has  kid friendly menus, and there are posters announcing Kids Outdoor Concerts. Looking forward to visiting their new location opening soon near Birkdale Village."

We sat at one of the large outside tables for an hour or so but eventually it just got a little too hot for the babies. I saw a large inside table and asked the outside waitress Laura if there was any chance we could move inside. After a few minutes she came back and said the inside staff was setting the table for us and they would help move everything inside. Not a hint of inconvenience from her, the hostess, the food runners, or our inside waitress.  Excellent service all around, and all the food and drinks were great. Ordering outside with the online tab was remarkably quick also. The indoor and outside space is well thought out and comfortable. Great community play area for kids just out front."

We got lucky and there was a table of ladies talking loud enough that I'm sure their husband's could hear them at home.   Once they left I could hear myself think.  Our waitress was nice, yet it was one of those times we're you knew she was stretched too thin.  (As I walked out, she was having to serve tables outside that room.)  I ordered a diet coke that was delivered to the table in a small aluminum can with a cup of ice.  I decided on ice tea and it was good. As for the lunch order, I got the Grilled Chicken Panino.  It was very good.  As a side, I ordered the Crispy Brussels Sprouts.  They were tasty but loaded in oil.  It was a large bowl full.   My wife got the SPB Burger.  I got a taste of it and we both agreed it was good.  Her side was Hand Cut Belgian Fries.  They too were good.  My wife ordered a porter beer and enjoyed it.  Our daughter and our 2 yr old granddaughter was with us and we  decided to order the chicken strip with fries for the granddaughter.  There wasn't a children's meal selection,  yet she ate some of both.\nOverall, we enjoyed ourselves yet aren't clamoring to return.    I'm not sure how much the bill was as I left before it came.  I asked my wife to take care of it.   The chairs that appear to be throughout the restaurant were uncomfortable for me.  By the time I got up, my back was hurting.   I wish those who return enjoy their meals.  However. I'm not recommending."

The eggs are done just right, the gravy well seasoned. The bisquits were good, but a little rubbery. The ale was excellent, I ordered the Marshmallow Tree Top and expected a little more marshmallow. It had a nice mellow flavor. My boyfriend had the sausage eggs and bacon. The sausage was very well spiced and tender. The service was fast and friendly. I would give this place 4 1/2 stars if I could as they try very hard and I will come back to try other dishes. All in all it was a great experience. I plan to bring more people here too!"

However, the flawed biscuit really messed up the sandwich. I ended up taking the chicken off and just eating it without the biscuit. That defeats the purpose of the sandwich.\n\nI mentioned this to the server and the manager. They both acknowledged problems with getting the biscuit right. The manager said they were working on adjustments in the cooking process to correct the issue. If it is not right,  you know it's not right, it shouldn't be on the menu until you can get it right.\n\nDisappointing experience. Not sure I would return here. Legion, OMB, Middle James are better brewery/restaurant options in my opinion."

The house salad is also very good.  Suffolk Punch knows how to do it right. I look forward to coming back to both locations."

Our waitress, Heather, was very attentive and did a good job being cordial and taking our orders.\n\nThe food was pretty dang good, too. We had the tuna nachos, and these are a MUST HAVE appetizer. They were delicious. My main dish - the hot chicken sandwich - was extremely spicy. I was surprised that such a hot sandwich was offered to the general public. It came to me in a puddle of red oil and was basically too spicy to eat, I could not finish it because my mouth was on fire.\n\nMy wife ordered the salmon and roasted carrot salad and loved it.\n\nOverall, the food and service was mostly pretty good - but the front of the house needs some help. Oh, and tone down the spice on the hot chicken sandwich, please."

The ordering system here will stun you--the server sends back your order instantly and runners bring it out moments later... our drinks, apps and kids' meals were delivered in minutes! Again, this was prime time on a rainy Saturday with a Charlotte FC game on! Food is high quality as always, inventive and delicious. Get the brussels and pretzel with cheese sauce!!!!
