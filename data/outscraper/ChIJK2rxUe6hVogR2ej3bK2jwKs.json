We had just eaten so we settle on a couple of drinks with the promise that we would return to try the food.  The bar was great as the servers were quick and the drinks were good.  We didn't have any custom cocktails so not much to rate other than they had a great selection.  They have custom cocktails available but we didn't get any.\n\nOn our second visit to Monarch we planned to eat dinner and take advantage of the many options.  I landed on Maroon Market which I was quickly disappointed.  I tried to order several things and everything i tried to order they were out of.  This was very frustrating but I'll give them another shot on my next visit and hopefully they will be better stocked.\n\nSince I couldn't get what I wanted at Maroon Market I slide a couple of spots down to Seoul Good which was a great experience.  The lady service was super nice and helpful.  We ordered one of their custom corndogs (half cheese half corn dog) which was an interesting concept.

The lady service was super nice and helpful.  We ordered one of their custom corndogs (half cheese half corn dog) which was an interesting concept.  They have additional options of breading that range from panko to crumbled hot cheetos (or something similar).  These were actually much better than I expected.  I also ordered the tofu rice bowl.  I wasn't a fan of how the tofu was cooked but overall it was a delicious meal and very filling."

I could've went to an event at Spectrum and spent less with alcohol included. Not to sham the tenants because rent must be expensive but to pay over $18 a person and not get even close to full on stall food is ridiculous.\n\nBeautiful place - poor parking situation.

It wasn't busy at all and only 4 ppl sitting at the bar. So I sat and had a drink. The Bartender walks off to chit chat with a lady at the end of the bar he apparently knew. Approx 15mins past and everyone is calling out for his attention the entire 15mins & he decided to ignore EVERYONE & continued with his conversation. So I interrupted and said: Excuse me... we are all trying to get your attention. At this time he rolls his eyes and said: \"I'm sorry, this job isn't important enough for me to rush to y'all aid. If the building ain't burning down & theres no real emergency you all can wait. That happened to be a good friend of mine I haven't seen in some years... so Excuse me if I wanted to catch up with her.\" I asked him if he remembered he is at work on the clock to do a service for the ppl /his customers. I'm sure you have lunch and breaks for that. At this point he started yelling and cursing at me telling me he didn't care and non of us are important enough for him to care.\nThis went on for some time until I asked for the Manager & he stated: Oh would you like me to FETCH. The manager for you like I care... you just hold on while I FETCH for you! This situation got so nasty for not reason at all! 1st and last time there if this is the type of employees they are hiring in their NEW ESTABLISHMENT! This was completely unacceptable, unprofessional, disrespectful & just disgusting overall! It is my mission at this time to let as many ppl know about the Monarch Market and my experience. I surely hope and pray the other patrons complain as well!"

Dishes are lunch sized and a bit higher priced due to the location but not bad enough for me to not make this place a regular stop. There are lots of options in here and a giant central bar with TV's to relax at (if not working lol). Will definitely need to drag my boyfriend here to meet me for a midweek lunch."

I understand the cost of food went up, however it won't be a good 9-5 option from Monday through Friday. $20 for a weekday lunch is not sustainable. However we had curry gate, and it was just as good as the original curry gate and the price was very reasonable. My Palak Paneer with jasmine rice was $12. It will definitely a go to place for a drink and once in a while for a special lunch."

They have mini good stations set up as to how you would see it inside of a mall at food court.  I walked around to each station as I was undecided on what I had a taste for, but I knew I wanted something delicious to eat. I chose, \"Rolled AF.\" Interesting name, right? I ordered a \"Birria crunchwrap.\" As, of course, it comes with the dipping sauce. When I tell  you, everything was amazing from the layers to the seasoning & perfectly sealed. It's so neatly stacked and fulfilling. I only ate 1/2 of the wrap. You can choose your choice of protein. It's not included.  I paid almost $17, but it's so worth it. It's a beautiful atmosphere for date nights or a girls /guys night out type of vibe."

They all use the same point of sale (receipts all say \"Monarch Market\"), so that shouldn't be hard.\n\nThe address listed on the website for the parking garage seems incorrect, but we ended up finding a spot on the street anyway.\n\nYes, some places seem pricey to make a full meal.  The $13.50 chick bap from Seoul Good was ok if you're not super hungry. Might need to add a Korean hot dog, which would be another $7. The focaccia sandwich I got from the Italian street food place was $12 and were a decent size. I just wish it had been hot, not room temp. The best value seemed to be the $10 Nam Khap (called a lettuce wrap, but basically fried rice ok top of lettuce in a prepackaged container) from the Laotion place."

Dumpling place wasn't open.  Barley and Burger has great smashed burger with prices comparable to other restaurants uptown.  The two bars are nice touches.  Will try the other restaurants soon."
