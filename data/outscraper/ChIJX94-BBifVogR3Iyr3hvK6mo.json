Although it wasn't my favorite with the fries in the gyro it tasted good. The homemade tzatziki sauce was really good. I got the hummus as a side which also had a great taste. I bought the baklava for my fiance which she thought it was good but very sweet. I gave the atmosphere a 4 only because it was empty and I ordered to go. Overall the food is good and I will go there again. Do go and try it for yourselves though and I'm sure you'll also leave there satisfied with your food."
