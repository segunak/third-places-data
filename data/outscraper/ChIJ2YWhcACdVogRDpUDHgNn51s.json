But the duck skin wasn't crispy at all, had too much fat under the skin, and was served lukewarm. The marinated egg was so overcooked it was rubbery and inedible. The only decent part was the baby bok choy, that was cooked crisp tender (but also served lukewarm). Not worth $17.\n\nPeking duck jianbing - this took about 15 minutes so I expected it to be piping hot. It wasn't lukewarm but it didn't taste like it was freshly made either. The thin slices of Peking duck were decent in tenderness and flavor but the amount was skimpy. The jianbing was full of fried wonton pieces and lettuce as filler. It was edible but not worth $15.\n\nMochinut - we got the original with sprinkles. It was really good. Not too sweet. Nice and chewy. $3.50 each. You pay at the kiosk and when they call your name, you tell them what flavor you want."

The menus are displayed and equipped with prices. The workers at Great Wall were a bit rude one time so I've never eaten there. Yume is great, honey buns is great, Rai Lay (spell check) is great, and the Croffles from the croffle spot are delicious. Mochinut always has a long line Everytime I go so I assume they are great as well but I haven't had anything there personally."

All of the spots in Alley 51 were Asian: Thai, Japanese, Korean, Chinese and more! And they have savory and sweet. So I tried the Pho Ga - traditional Vietnamese chicken soup - (because my fav mom and pop spot closed after the pandemic RIP!). It was a large portion, reasonably priced and had all the fixins: sprouts, basil, jalapenos, limes, cilantro and onions. Of course, I requested the hoisin and sriracha. Pho came out pipin hot! And it was fresh and good. Wish the broth had a bit more flavor but not bad. Service was great. The young lady walked me around the menu versus just asking what I wanted. I would go back and try something else there."

My toddler loved the kids' play area with a slide, connect 4, little table and nugget couch to jump on.  Family restroom  was hard to find (please put up restroom signs  )had a changing table and was spacious.  The food hall was quite clean overall and even had an arcade with Dance dance revolution and other games.\n\nThere is a little market section where you can buy snacks and drinks too.

The food is delicious from a couple different restaurant kiosks. They have  selfies backdrop walls inside and outside. Super cute.\nLooking forward to going again to try the other food options. Some of the restaurants are still not open so we'll have to go visit when they open."
