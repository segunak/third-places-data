We got the Bun (rice vermicelli) with grilled pork from Saigon Cafe and the rice noodles were a mushy overcooked mess. I asked for the noodles to be remade and the same thing happened so I requested a refund. I hope they can find a new cook or provide proper training on how to cook fresh rice noodles.\n\nThe other issue is they didn't include fresh cilantro, the bean sprouts weren't very fresh, and the pork was grisly and chewy. I don't think they cooked it at high enough heat because there wasn't a char on the meat.\n\n...\nOriginal review:\n\nTried it today for the first time and was disappointed with what we got.\n\nGreat Wall - had high hopes when we saw the hanging roast ducks and char siu pork hanging in the windows. But the duck skin wasn't crispy at all, had too much fat under the skin, and was served lukewarm. The marinated egg was so overcooked it was rubbery and inedible. The only decent part was the baby bok choy, that was cooked crisp tender (but also served lukewarm). Not worth $17.\n\nPeking duck jianbing - this took about 15 minutes so I expected it to be piping hot. It wasn't lukewarm but it didn't taste like it was freshly made either. The thin slices of Peking duck were decent in tenderness and flavor but the amount was skimpy. The jianbing was full of fried wonton pieces and lettuce as filler. It was edible but not worth $15.\n\nMochinut - we got the original with sprinkles. It was really good. Not too sweet. Nice and chewy. $3.50 each. You pay at the kiosk and when they call your name, you tell them what flavor you want."

If you don't want to grab a hearty meal, there are a few dessert options that have your sweet tooth or activities to indulge in, like karaoke on certain nights, claw games, and gift shops. There is an international grocery store attached right to it.\nPricing from each restaurant varies, but out of the 3 restaurant I've tried, they're fairly priced for a considerable amount of food.\nThe seating is first come, first serve. However, there is plenty of seating even on a packed weekend.\nAll in all, this place is worth a try for anyone. Kids, adults, vegetarians, vegans, and meat eaters alike."

I'm giving it 3 stars, deducting one due to the limited vegetarian options--most vendors offer only one or two choices, while some have none at all, which is disappointing for plant-based diners. Another star is deducted for serving dine-in meals in disposable plastic containers, which significantly contributes to landfill waste and environmental degradation. Investing in sustainable servingware would greatly improve the dining experience. I'd gladly reconsider my rating if these issues are addressed."

Me and my family have had the delight to go almost weekly and try something new every time we go. Even if you don't want a big meal, they have multiple appetizers and small meals for a lighter dish. They seem expensive but you get your moneys worth. My wife and I love sharing meals, and when we don't want the same thing, we have delicious leftovers. Aside from foods and snacks, they also have arcade with rhythm games, claw machines, and surprise figures for adults and kids to enjoy. We have so much fun playing DDR and the Wacca games. For those with young kids, there is a play area to let those young ones roam around. The atmosphere is amazing. It has dim lighting that isn't too dark or too bright, which gives it a very welcoming and comfy feeling. The lines for food are orderly, and all areas of the place are kept clean and tidy. I have never been to an event area/dine hall with such clean bathrooms. For those with sensory issues, it can get a little rowdy and loud. I do recommend some headphones. They also have an outside area that is also comfy. Overall, I recommend this place for anyone and everyone who loves food and asian culture. Whether you come alone or with a large group of friends, it's an experience you can not miss out on!"

The menus are displayed and equipped with prices. The workers at Great Wall were a bit rude one time so I've never eaten there. Yume is great, honey buns is great, Rai Lay (spell check) is great, and the Croffles from the croffle spot are delicious. Mochinut always has a long line Everytime I go so I assume they are great as well but I haven't had anything there personally."

So I tried the Pho Ga - traditional Vietnamese chicken soup - (because my fav mom and pop spot closed after the pandemic RIP!). It was a large portion, reasonably priced and had all the fixins: sprouts, basil, jalapenos, limes, cilantro and onions. Of course, I requested the hoisin and sriracha. Pho came out pipin hot! And it was fresh and good. Wish the broth had a bit more flavor but not bad. Service was great. The young lady walked me around the menu versus just asking what I wanted. I would go back and try something else there."

My toddler loved the kids' play area with a slide, connect 4, little table and nugget couch to jump on.  Family restroom  was hard to find (please put up restroom signs  )had a changing table and was spacious.  The food hall was quite clean overall and even had an arcade with Dance dance revolution and other games.\n\nThere is a little market section where you can buy snacks and drinks too.

Come on, there is no service. You order at the counter and pick up your food by yourself. Why do you ask for tips?

There is a place for little kids to play around, and a place to do Japanese arcade games. The seating is also very convenient. There is also seating outside, and has great photo potential."
