I got the famous iced coffee and my wife got a flavored latte of some sort and neither one of us thought it was all that good. My wife got the blueberry peach muffin and I got the avocado toast. Muffin had little to no flavor and the avocado toast was not even toasted. It came out as hot bread with a smear of avocado and balsamic drizzle on top. Would not suggest this place to visitors and won't return. Staff was nice and patient while we ordered."

The service however is inconsistent, One time Americano was great with two side little chocolates, another time it tasted watery. Customer service is not friendly, not sure if they are getting any training to greet customers properly. Restrooms are not taking care, advised them that they are out of towels, no one took care of it. This place could have been great with proper customer service training and consistent coffee quality.\""

I ordered avocado toast. Then I was told they have run out of avocados. So I ordered the smoked salmon. And guess what -- I was then told they were out of Salmon too. Why not cross the things off the menu when you're out? Or when you have a chance to tell me that you have no avocados, also tell me that you have no salmon! And how about an apology instead of a blank stare. \"I'm so sorry, but we are out of several things today... Avocados, and salmon\" would sure go along way.\n\n2.  When I completed my order, I was told I should sit down and that they would find me. I thought this meant my food would be delivered. Nope. It means they will call out what you ordered and set it on the bar to get cold. They did not ask my name so they could not call me by name. And I didn't know the menu name of what I had ordered, so I did not recognize that. The place was busy and noisy so I did not hear them call much of anything... My sandwich sat on the bar for a long time before I got so hungry I went looking.\n\nThe big things are done really well at this place. The pastries, sandwiches, and oh my the coffee... All are terrific. Now, if they could just ice the little things -- like customer service -- it would be my favorite place.  I'll add a 5th star when that happens!"

I told him I needed a second & luckily I had another employee serve me.\nI asked for a recommendation in which she thought of the white chocolate caramel latte (which was on point). I was inquisitive about a couple things & she was very knowledgeable & even let me try the nicaraguan drip coffee.  She encapsulates the personality that draws people in. Great coffee alone doesn't flourish a business, the people do. <3"

I was skeptical when Waterbean bought it, but thought I would still try it out. They have completely ruined the warmth in this coffee shop while trying to convert it to a \"modern\" coffee shop. It's all white and plain. There's no life to the place anymore. It's boring, bland and cold in its style. When I look for a place to spend time I want somewhere inviting and cozy. This place just no longer has that. The way it was when it was \"Unwind\" was perfect. They captured every aspect of what a coffee shop should be. It's a bummer Waterbean isn't able to hold onto that. On top of that, their coffee is subpar at best and I wish they still had the many tea options as before. It made the place unique.

They have loose tea of all kinds and flavors. I got a latte which was perfect (not too hot and not too cool) If you love plants they have some hanging from the ceiling in the cutest hangers. Tables outside on Main St. Free public parking on side street (Dover)."

The atmosphere and food is amazing, ESPECIALLY the breakfast flatbread with salsa. This is a must have!!!  The coffee and incredibly wide selection of teas is also mind blowing. This has become my go to spot in the mornings for my coffee and food fix to start my day off right. Plus it's a privately owned local business."
