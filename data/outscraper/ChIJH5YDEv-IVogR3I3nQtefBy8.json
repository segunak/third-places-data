Their storefront is gorgeous, the space is beautiful and really a great spot in town- 10/10 for the atmosphere and physical location. However, each time I've been in- no one welcomes you when you arrive and it almost feels like the baristas have been annoyed by my questions or on half of the occasions they've been talking with coworkers while I'm standing there to get my order taken. The to-go service is incredibly fast which is great but  the times I've been in there's been things that were forgotten from my order or sat at the counter for a long time bc I didn't know it was ready. Their drip was incredibly good but the other drinks I've ordered- iced lattes, iced americanos, hot americanos have been lacking I'm not sure if the staff are as trained as you would expect from such a high quality location. I hope great things for this small business and I hope that their baristas grow in knowledge and hospitality."

There was a little on street parking in front of the shop but not much.  The other option was the mud pit across the street that screamed \"hold my beer and watch this\".  I think there was some more parking further past the shop but cannot say for sure.\n\nWhen we walked in we were in awe of the inside of this place.  It is one of the largest, private coffee shops I've visited.  Plenty of seating and alot of open space.  I checked in on Yelp, as I always do, and noticed a free latte.  When I showed that to the person taking our order she and the gentleman she called over both said they had never seen it before and didn't know anything about it.  They did say they were going to honor the perk but after pointing out that it required a $15-$20 purchase I opted not to use it.\n\nI ordered a cold brew and a chai latte with almond milk.  Both were served correctly as ordered and quickly.  I noticed the cold brew looked like a dark tea and the taste wasn't that far off from a dark tea either.  I take my cold brew black and usually have to water it down because it's so strong however, this tasted very watered down already.  It tasted like what I've made at home and didn't let brew long enough.  I asked the barista if their cold brew normally looked that light and she just said \"yes\" while walking away.  No concern that I would be asking that question which probably should have raised a red flag.  Next was the chai - equally watered down.  It was pretty much just warmed almond milk.  At this point I just decided it wasn't my day for coffee and let it be."

They also have individual roasters where you can come and roast your own coffee and classes to help you. We were welcomed and given information by Kevin, who is so welcoming and friendly. Just moved to their area; can't wait to make this our regular coffee shop to hang out at.  They normally have live music, but not right now during COVID."

The table I sat at while I waited for my order had a sign labeled \"clean\" but it was clear due to the crumbs all over the table it was in fact not clean. Normally I wouldn't mind as much about a less than stellar table, but we are still in a pandemic so it's a little concerning regular procedures are not being upheld along with extra cleanliness efforts to prohibit the spread of COVID-19. When I received my latte it tasted very burnt, in fact I was almost certain I had been given decaf instead of regular espresso (I am also a barista so I am very familiar with the difference). Either way, it was not very good and I could only stand to drink about 1/4 of the drink before tossing it out. I had high hopes it would be a great place with great coffee since it was a local company with local roasting. I'm sad to say I did not have a great or even good first impression, apart from the decor itself. I'm not sure I'll be back..."

Right now they have a small retail space that is open with limited hours. If you're lucky to catch them when they are open pick up some beans, or a cup of freshly roasted and brewed coffee. You won't be disappointed. Their IPO is the most popular, but they also have great Jamaican and decaf available. The decaf is a nice dark roast, so if you like the taste of good coffee without the caffeine then this is for you. It's not a light, watered down decaf, it actually has taste! Can't wait until they open their larger location."
