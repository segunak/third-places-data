I asked the girl who took my order, she seemed confused, and asked another girl in the back to come out. The 2nd girl told me someone else must have taken it. I was sitting at the 1st table by the pickup counter - it was never put up. After quite a bit of back and forth, she offered to make it now.  I declined.  At that point, no apology had been offered and no sense of urgency was displayed to get me the sandwich I had paid for.  I asked for a refund and was told they couldn't do it. They took down my information and said the manager would be in touch.  That was 2 weeks ago and no one has contacted me.  I was issued a refund for the sandwich. The lack of care and customer service was appalling. I understand mistakes happen but at no point did they try to make it right and insisted that someone else had taken my order. Even if that was the case ( it wasn't), the order should have been remade."

I asked one of the women up front about it, wondering when it might be ready, to which she responded something along the lines of \"we're in the middle of a morning rush, it'll be ready when it's ready\".  I waited another 5 minutes before I just gave up and left, as I had somewhere to be. The Park Rd./Quail Corners location never has an issue with ordering ahead on the app."

I ordered a Vietnamese coffee for $6.47 only for the barista to fill up my coffee cup, less than half full. As soon as I got my Vietnamese coffee, I took a picture of my less than half-full cup because I was so shocked. When I approached the counter to politely ask why it wasn't filled all the way, she goes \"that's just how it is because I didn't put ice\". She also begged for a tip and made a face if I didn't leave one so for that, I have to give the service a one star as well. My friend also ordered a hot coffee and the coffee wasn't warm whatsoever and had giant chunks of coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup. If you want overly priced, half full, mediocre coffee, waterbean on metropolitan is the place for that. I hope they fix their customer service and their quality of coffee in the near future."

The cashier woman kept getting more orders vs working on my sandwich - which made my late and I had to get up and ask for a refund. I'm really upset about this considering they are pretty good with mobile orders. Train your employees better. Why offer mobile orders if they're last priority.\n\nNEW REVIEW:\nSince leaving my previous review they've gotten so much better at taking care of mobile orders. Thank you for always being fast!!! Some of workers recognize me now which I appreciate because it makes me feel valuable :)"

What a great concept! My favorite was the Blossom, it was strong but very earthy. It held its own against all the others. I also got a Ice coffee with lavender syrup and a splash of oat milk which was a yummy sweet treat after the flight. My sister got a smoothie because she's not a coffee girl and I appreciated that they had options like that for the nine coffee drinkers. We didn't grab food because we had other plans but I will definitely visit this spot again!"

It was a very gorgeous and elaborate space with terrific drinks and cutting edge equipment and methods. I heard the brand started here in Charlotte and the owner was Vietnamese (which made sense), so while visiting the city I was excited to try the original. I haven't had a good Vietnamese iced coffee since living in VN, so I was very hopeful. It was strange that I had to pay extra for the sweetened condensed milk because that is literally the other essential ingredient besides coffee in a ca phe sua da (VN iced coffee). Unfortunately, the drink was horrible, and much more like a thin, tart latte than a rich and robust VN iced coffee. The atmosphere and seating were very pleasant and the barista was terrific, but the overpriced drink was disappointing for sure."

Apparently after 2 week (May 8), the barista(dark hair) recognized us and intentionally made 4 out of 6 drinks wrong from size, to hot or cold and the milk alterative. When a staff member intentionally makes a drink incorrectly, management should reassess who they hire. Someone can come in with health issues and cause health risk for that person.

She warmed up my blueberry muffin - it's a little thing, but also means a lot. How many times have you been in a coffee shop and wondered how good your treat would be if it was warmed up? (It was delicious, by the way.)\n\nI never felt pressured to give up my table. It's a COVID-compliant establishment and I felt comfortable and safe there. I'll definitely come by again and maybe try the snickerdoodle coffee, which sounds amazing. Greta, thank you for your hospitality!

I came in and had never been to waterbean before and usually drink starbucks and had no idea what i wanted. I was greeted as soon as i walked in the door. The barista Tori was so knowledgable about the coffee and the different type of roasts. I will be going out of my way to come see Tori! Not to mention her super fun hair and gorgeous tattoos!!! Super respectful and sweet!"

Parking is large and very easily accessible to be in uptown, with no fee to park which impresses me for the location. I also love that someone handicap can easily access and navigate the shop from outside. We come back again and again, highly recommend!"

After another 5 minutes - this is a pic of the beer we're waiting for- she says something is wrong with the tap. She did at least offer a refund- but we waited another 5 minutes for management to come out and give us the refund. Not the girls fault honestly."

The environment is lovely and warm, the service was terrible this morning. I stood at the counter for a good 5 to 6 minutes with no barista or employee in sight. When she showed up, no apology or explanation, no thank you when I payed (she actually said 'you're welcome' instead), just no personable attributes going on- just another customer, who cares kinda vibe. I ordered the Guatemala, which was ok. Their coffee has a very 'beany', earthy flavor, not much personality. I prefer Starbucks or Not Just Coffee for taste. I'd probably come back for other beverages, wifi and convenience ONLY."
