They also have a selection of freshly baked goods that pair perfectly with your coffee.\n\nWhat really stands out, though, is the friendly and attentive service. The baristas are fantastic; welcoming, skilled, and clearly passionate about what they do.   I had a cappuccino that was perfectly balanced, and she tried \"The Brunette,\" a blend of lavender and velvety chocolate. Both drinks were excellent, we enjoyed them a lot.  Overall, a great spot to relax and enjoy a well-made cup of coffee!"

The gentleman who made our coffee had a phenomenal attitude and truly took pride in his work.  It was very clean and inviting and most of all the coffee, we order a teddy, was DELICOUS. I was skeptical from its ingredients and being picky but wow I can't wait to buy it again. We had out 2 children with us as well so we order them a banana chocolate muffin. It was absolutely delicious as well. I can't not praise this place enough. Definitely worth going and trying! You won't regret. They have muffins, cinnamon roll, hot coffee for 6 bucks or iced for 6.50. Worth every penny."
