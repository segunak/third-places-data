The appearance of the sandwich was disappointing. I hope Panera enhances their cleaning practices to ensure a more appealing presentation in the future."

I said Ma'am I literally didn't throw anything at you, I asked you to smell how spoiled they are... She gets an attitude, then here comes another \"manager\" (2nd Team) and ask what's the issue I then explain it and she too gets an attitude and says they don't make enough money for this... I said That's not my issue, my issue is the order was wrong and y'all got an attitude with me the customer and I happen to be a stockholder for Speaking up about it, and asking for fresh food and the correct order...

I always order the same stuff and only at this location I always have issues with my order.\n1. Kids deli turkey sandwich sounds really simple to make - just bread, turkey and cheese. I received either grilled cheese, either turkey sandwich with salad in it. Oh, and they can't cut it in half for some reason. It's the only Panera I've received any excuse for cutting my kids sandwich in half lol why, I still don't have the true answer.\n2. Usually half of sandwich looks pretty decent half everywhere but not in this Panera. I always switch to Country Sourdough bread and their side of half sandwich is smaller than the kids size meal lol I mean, it's like literally 1/3 of the whole sandwich. When you order the same sandwich pretty often, you expect to receive the same thing as always. Well, not here!\n3. One time ordered tuna sandwich as usual and got some chicken chipotle stuff. After that always check my order in front of the window.\n4. One time I ordered Broccoli Cheddar Soup and it was iced in the middle of the cup lol Today I received this soup liquid as water.\n5. Manager said that they will make me a new sandwich but it's going to be exactly the same size when I was explaining to her that this is not usual half of the sandwich I receive. I'd be fine to stay with this one but she already touched it with her hands so I was agreed to receive a new one. Guess what? They gave me the same sandwich I got for the first time saying that it's a new one lol why?\nToday when I came inside to solve the issue with my order again lol I heard like the girl from stuff was kinda annoyed than something is going to happen now if I'm standing with my two opened sandwiches. Manager was giving me all excuses and reasons kinda to tell me that I was wrong. I don't know, just not my place I guess because I always have some problems with my order, stuff and manager in general."

Now it's becoming increasingly frustrating since you can't pop in grab your cup of coffee with the iPad. Have to wait in line to receive your cup usually it's not there automatically have to go ask for it Wait again until they find it. Then you get to the coffee the coffee is out.

Unfortunately the driver left my drink at the restaurant and was unreachable. When I called the restaurant about the missing drink and one other small issue, the manager absolutely went above and beyond to rectify the situation. I was offered several options and never for a moment felt like I was being a \"problem customer.\" Both the manager and one of their employees blew my mind with their customer service - I will 100% continue to frequent this location and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Panera. All other locations and restaurants should follow this store's lead. Mistakes happen even at the best of stores, but this level of customer service is not seen as often today. I am insanely impressed and pleased and will be back again!"

Coffee is also very good. Atmosphere is like being at a log cabin or a down home feel. One especially nice perk of Panera is its no plastic utensils.  Real plates and such. Overall it's a good meal for a very decent price. I would recommend this establishment.  All food is natural, no preservativesor fake colors."

Ordered through the kiosk which was rather easy, however, they prepared one of our salads wrong. What's the point of customizing a salad to take things OFF the salad, if they intend on keeping it on the salad anyway? Pay too much to pick through your food to get what you actually ordered. Asked for no tomato's and onions... Got it anyway."

The salad would have been ok if it hadn't had alot of wilted lettuce that made the salad very bitter . So pretty much the sour dough bread was the only thing that was  edible in my opinion.  So if you want to pay 19.00dollars for a piece of bread  I recommend eating here if not I  recommend you pick up your order  before  paying."

More than likely it was the bottom of what was left in the pot. I get there was an hour left until you guys closed but at least let someone know the soup is almost out. Very dissatisfied  Panera."
