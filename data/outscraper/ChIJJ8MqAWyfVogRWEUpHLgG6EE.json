A singular drink should not take this long to fulfill unless you are working on sourcing the coffee beans to make the drink.\n\nI love Night Swim coffee and want to continue to support them. However, if the customer service/experience at this location is not reviewed for opportunities to improve and deliver a better experience I will happily take my business and support elsewhere."

Did you have to change the name from skinny dip because you live in the Bible Belt?  One thing I'm not questioning is the snarky entitlement attitude of your coffee server.  Act like you want your customers' patronage and not like people don't have choices.  And your bagels are garbage, just stop trying to pass those off, call them day old bread rounds?"

The coffee is consistently good, and the environment is generally comfortable for both quick visits and longer work sessions. However, I've noticed an unsettling trend with some of the staff. Their attitude seems overly partisan, and at times, unwelcoming to those who might not share their views. One staff member even questioned why I chose to frequent their cafe, hinting that I should consider other places.\n\nIt's concerning that this behavior is overlooked by the owners, as it significantly detracts from the otherwise positive aspects of the cafe. I hope management will encourage a more inclusive atmosphere moving forward, so the cafe can truly be a welcoming space for everyone."

Next the barista, not sure of her name was she was super sweet and gave me patience and explanation when ordering. The restrooms are gender neutral, safe, fully stocked and clean. Then the roaster/machines on the side I found super intriguing and Rory- thank you so much, what an awesome human! Explained coffee and the process in detail that I could understand- it was definitely an intro, but extremely interesting nevertheless and allowed me to take some photos and video. The food and drinks were delicious. My partner had a blueberry muffin and I had the cereal milk matcha latte- so so sooo good. I asked for whipped cream as I was comparing to Starbucks- silly old me- Night Swim puts Starbucks to shame!!! One sip and no whipped cream necessary like literally so good!! The blue berry muffin is vegan- matter of fact I think everything is vegan there and my friend didn't save me any- it was that good! lol.. i also had the everything bagel and seasonal chive cream cream. The bagel was a bit salty, but i like salt so that works for me. Someone else may say otherwise so heads up for that. The cream cheese was very fresh and spot on- rivals New York Bagel Shop cream cheese!! Kudos!! Thank you for making my day! So glad we decided to take the detour on the way to work!! Atmosphere is super chill. Will definitely be back!!!"
