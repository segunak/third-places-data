You get your own drinks and refills. Here's a buzzer, come get your food. This place sucks. It's just a convenience store without a fryer because you can't get fries with your burger, so I hope you like chips. How this place calls itself a restaurant is beyond me. I guess gas stations, Walmart, and anywhere else you can get a drink and a sandwich is a restaurant now too."

Taco Tuesday's street tacos were terrific. Wednesday's Big Ass Burritos were DEFINITELY big ass burritos.  Thursday's free \"wine\" tasting was informative. (We tasted sake, which we'd never had before.) Friday's Brisket was to die for. Saturday's, I'm in and out for drinks and food while playing PokemonGo! The atmosphere, camaraderie, and overall sense of being \"at home\" in this place will bring you back again and again! (It obviously did ME anyway!)\nJuly 2022: we are still regulars at East Frank because it's not just a food place. It's also the hangout for old, and new, friends, and chosen family. I would never have thought that people eating at a restaurant or going out for drinks would become family, but they did.\nThis place also has Trivia and Drag nights that are great fun for all!\nNov 2024: We still love EF for their food and fun atmosphere. They have a lot of the same familiar menu but add new delicious items in constantly."

There is a selection of interesting packaged beverages, candies, and chips available for purchase, and a quirky selection of novelty toys for sale.

I asked a couple other friends if I was alone in this feeling, and unfortunately, it's the same for others. I will update again if/when they get the food back right!!\n\nGreat craft selection.

I ordered a banh-mi sandwich and a side of potato salad. It definitely didn't leave me disappointed but seemed fairly par. The combination of the space, availability of food, and decent tap list along with a fair selection  of packaged goods make it a really great spot where each of those things on their own would be fairly ordinary.\n\nBottom line, if I lived in the area, I'd definitely go back again. I'd be willing to bet they have something on their food menu that is killer.\n\nThere's a good chance I'll go again this weekend and most times when I visit."

The nicest people, the nicest collection of Star Trek Dishes and the nicest everything. At that point, I believe to remember, the store was pretty new and an addition to the first of its kind near/in (?) Charlotte. I am excited and very glad that it still exists and it seems the whole neighborhood has developed. If you aren't from the area but on your way from A to B: definitely stop by. All the best from Germany.\n\n(P.S.: I lived in Berlin for the past 10 years and never saw a place as cool as East Frank Superette and Kitchen. This either means I have no idea about Berlin ... or as I like to think: EFSK is just awesome.)"
