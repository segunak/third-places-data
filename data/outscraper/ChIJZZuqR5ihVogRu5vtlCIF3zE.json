I loved how the establishment is set up and it's meant for the professional who has culinary tastes. I enjoy the aesthetics of the entire place including the little dog park and other fun things to do. Not every stall is great but my favorite is the Asian market. It's a clean set up and reminds me of being in 7-11 in Japan, Hawaii, or Hong Kong.\n\nVery cool place and looking forward to taking friends/family here. If you're looking for basic American  food please stick to Waffle House or Bojangles but if you're here wanting to try international food items you'll be more than pleasantly surprised here.\n\nWe enjoyed the Korean stone dish and absolutely loved the bento boxes they offer"

You know youre in the wrong place when no one here in a \"asian\" themed food court is asian. The matcha was more watered down than my dying overwatered elephant ear, and the only cool aspect was the asian themed grocery store, but you cant mess up prepackaged food. Except the only thing that they did make and package was the strawberry sando which tasted like my childhood communion bread. Way to awaken my religious trauma thanks.  My recommendation if you want authentic asian food, and you want to support actual asian communities, and not some douchecanoe white guy in a suit that wrote a fat check to get this cash grab going i recommend super g mart the dumplings in the back are amazing, and the buns are even better, grab a hello kitty microwave on the way out too.\n\nThe matcha cofflee was good tho."

I suggest you clean your stove burners because getting warm soup after 20 minutes waiting is pathetic. I asked them for Togo container immediately. Tasted the broth and it was mild (not medium like I requested) with no flavor. Got home and put gochujang and chili flakes to make it actually edible.\n\nDon't order here, order from Kaudon."

I started out as a customer and recently inquired about selling their food in my store here in uptown. Because I just opened my store, I was not able to guarantee the required 40 items per order, just yet. The owner and I discussed that we would catch back up in a month or so with other options but agreed that I would continue to buy retail price. I come in today (Thursday/half off day) like I have the past 3 weeks (Tues & Thurs) and was treated and talked to like I had a tail, worse actually! The \"manager\" (lady w glasses, when I asked - she wouldn't give me her name) questioned me purchasing 5 meals, when I explained to her the owner was aware,  she says \"yeah, I know everything\", \"this food is personal and this is for your business, correct?\" - I said yes. They stopped ringing me up and went to verify with the owner and came back talking to me like I was a liar and trying to hustle them. In short - it was an awful experience. I don't know why the owner would allow this, my assumption is ... they weren't interested in my business at all. I don't even have enough time to share how nasty they spoke to me. Based on the fact that they would allow someone to conduct themselves like this - even after it was verified ... I will not be coming back to this place. The sad/ironic thing is ... I've referred them to everyone I talk to! Food is great!! Behavior and communication is ugly."

The food stalls can be hit or miss, and sadly at times, I will run into low-quality food with a high price tag. It's hard to justify these prices when the food is below par. For example, today I received a Kalbi steak from The Rare Butcher and was very shocked at the size of it. It was a small scoop of corn and small pieces of meat and one was straight up a bone with a little bit of meat on it - all for almost $40**. I want to support local Asian businesses but I feel as though Urban District Market has fallen off. Sadly, Crispy Patty, KaUdon, and the Mini Market are the only spots that are worth their prices. Maybe it's a quality control issue or short staffing but I know for sure this place isn't hitting its full potential like it used to.\n\n**Edit: Double checked the receipt and the actual total was $38.47 including tip. Despite this, over $30 was spent on a subpar meal even if it was in a togo container :'("

This morning myself and another nanny were told we could not bring inside food in by Ish a worker at the super mart that sits in the middle of the building. Which we completely understood most of the time we buy lunch there anyway, we've had numerous occasions when we've had outside food and we've never had an issue. She then proceeds to tell us that we can't feed our 2.5 year old kids their lunch as well. We could visibly see other people feeding their children outside food and nothing was said to them in the same regard. There were no signs visible nor a policy on there website that reflects what we were told. I approached her again to further inquire why we couldn't feed the kids she was condescending, nasty, and rude. We asked her for her managers name and she refused to give it. We then tried to approach the manager to remedy the situation and we were blatantly ignored. We decided to leave and on our way out we approached a group of moms who had outside food as well. They said no one has ever said anything to them. They went up to inquire and she told them it was fine for the kids to eat after telling us numerous times they could not. This situation has left me feeling profiled and disgusted at the ignorance that I was subjected to this morning especially with no management to talk to to remedy the situation. I will no longer support this business and I think future patron should consider spending their money elsewhere."

But, to be honest, it felt like a well maintained mall food court with expensive food.\n\nStick Street was an okay corndog. The top of the corndog was filled with mozzarella cheese, and the corndog was a typical hotdog. Nothing special.\n\nCrispy Patty served a fried hamburger patty. Chicken nuggets were your avergae nuggets. Either item honestly  was not really well flavored.\n\nHC Burger company did have some very yummy bulgolgi. We had the Bulgogi melt, and that was yummy. Very flavorful. Took forever to get our food. However, it was my favorite thing we tried.\n\nAnd the Labratory was meh. The strawberry mule was full of ice and lacked any type of flavor.\n\nOverall, it is a more expensive way to try fried food. Better, less expensive, restaurants are out there."

At one stall, tempura vegetable and seafood selections are sitting under what should be heat lamps, but they are just light bulbs. Those items were almost cool to the touch (including the shrimp and fish), and stale. Not worth the expense at all. Dumplings at another stall were a mixed bag - some were hot, others were room temp at best. At a street food vendor, scallops were served cooked to only about 75% doneness, but were at least kept cold prior to cooking. At the supermarket, various onigiri (including seafood options) are confusingly available from both a cooler and a dry-goods shelf. I guess you decide whether you want food poisoning or not??\n\nThe biggest irk of the entire experience though? Unless you want a cocktail, the ONLY drink options in the entire place seem to be a cash-only Pepsi vending machine, or overpriced bottled lemonades from the supermarket. Interesting, considering the entire place is cashless, otherwise.\n\nThere are is also a children's play zone inside, which should be nice - but the toys seem like they came from a thrift shop. Luckily, there are hand sanitizer stations nearby! You'll need them.\n\nWith Optimist Hall just around the corner, save yourself the heartache and steer clear."

We ordered food from 3 stalls and dirt was variable - the Korean bowl was spectacular; the Udon noodles were tasty and satisfying, and the dumplings were underwhelming. I really loved the retail area that included Asian condiments from non-grocery store brands at reasonable prices. And clearly it is the place to be if you have a toddler and still want to enjoy a night out; they have a nice and well-subscribed indoor play area. We went during cold weather and are looking forward to going back\n\nMy only real complaint is that the food stalls could use better explanation on their displays - of the process of building your bowl, in some cases of pricing, and especially in the case of the tempura sandwich place, of the names of the food items that are pictured!"

Both were worthwhile\n\nThe lowlights were the lackluster food (compared to OH) the outrageous prices (compared to OH) and the nearly 30 minute wait to get food when there were no customers ahead of us. Our group ordered from five different stands at 3 pm on Sunday when no one was ordering food and the times for food were from 12 minutes for sticks to 28 minutes at bop bop.\n\nThe thing that absolutely ruined this place for our group was that it is RugRat central here.  Literally we counted over 60 kids.\n\nIf you are late 20s with your 3 year old this place is great. But our party was 15 to 42 years old and didn't appreciate the misbehaved children.\n\nMy recommendation is go here only on a weekday and go to monarch market or optimist hall for a better experience."

A satisfying bowl of jajiang udon at KaUdon was only $9.99.  The fried tempura add ons were not hot, though.\n\nWe also tried a hot stone pot from Bop Bop. The menu sign at the stall is misleading. When you order at the kiosk, it becomes clear that $13.99 doesn't include any actual meat. That adds another $1.99-$2.99 depending on what you choose. However, you do get to choose what kind of rice you want (they have purple!) and customize your vegetables. The stone pot really is worth an extra $2 over the regular \"rice bowl\" to keep everything nice and hot during your meal.\n\nWe also checked out the new market. There are a lot of cup ramens for sale, and a hot water dispenser and free toppings \"bar\" on site.\n\nFYI, there was a sign that the coffee place is currently only open 9 am-4 pm.\n\nAnd on weekends, there's a brunch buffet for $35.99."

My favorite out of all of this good food was definitely the Szechuan Shrimp from Stuffed. The flavor on them was amazing! There was nothing I did not like but I was expecting the Stone Bowl to be a soup. None the less all recommended. The prices were pretty reasonable. Everything was under $20 per item. The staff are kind and keep the place clean. We spoke with some of them about recommendations. I hate that I forgot his name but the bartender was kind and made amazing drinks. I definitely believe this place is worth a try. They even have some events or fun activities and a Korean snack area."

Difficult to find menus in some of the food stations - it appears to be all owned by the same operator.

The pork steamed buns looked and smelled almost raw. We let management know and they had them remade for us, but, who wants to eat again after biting into raw pork.  Our rice bowl was snagged by another patron before we could get it and the worker almost refused to remake ours....when they did it was mediocre at best.\n\nI love that they attempt to be family friendly but the food definitely needs to work out some kinks. We noticed that the kiosk system at each stall seems like a lame attempt at reducing labor costs since eat stall seemed to have one person working on prep (Thursday night).\n\nWe definitely won't be back anytime soon. It's missing any local flavor that you get from other food halls in the area."

With cocktails priced at almost $20 a drink and it being marketed as a distillery, I found that pretty misleading and unacceptable.

Stone bowl from Bop Bop wasn't bad, but not as exciting as the presentation. I could get something better from almost any food truck in town. I couldn't justify trying a $30+ steak in this setting from Rare Butcher. It's more of an upscale shopping mall food court than a showcase of local favorites. I really hope that changes."

We had employees staring at us awkwardly as we tried to check out the different food spots in the room. It's more like an open indoor food court than Optimist nearby. It's nice and hopefully will be great. But it needs more time. We got three tacos from Taco Adventure and had one each of beef, chicken and pork. They were awesome, and the corn tortillas were fresh and hearty. We will be back, but UDM needs some work to excel. It was so quiet while we were eating that I could unintentionally hear the conversation at another table."

The burger was subpar at best, full of gristle and loaded with tough chunks of meat. The patty itself has no intrinsic flavor and tasted as if there was zero seasoning whatsoever.\n\nI've read other reviews that sing praise for some of the other installments such as the LABoratory and Crispy Patty. I have yet to try those, but there are very few things that motivate me to return to Urban District Market.\n\nIn summation, you'd be better off visiting Optimist Hall. Unlike the Urban District Market, Optimist Hall has many more food options, a superior atmosphere, and markedly better prices when compared to the quality of the product."

Perfect place to grab food, sit outside and enjoy nice weather as you watch your kids play in splash pad or playground that's in between seoulfood and urban district market. Everyone has different taste and opinions so must go try it for yourself. Everyone is complaining about the price but what's not expensive these days?This place has so much potential. I Can't wait till they open up other stalls."

It was $15 for the meal and I ended up going somewhere else to eat afterwards since I was still starving. As someone who goes to ever andolo, haberdish, and other pricier restaurants in the area, I have no issue with paying more for quality food. The quality nor quantity matched the price for what I got. With optimist hall being a mile away with good quality food for less, they'll need to make some changes in order to stay competitive. Hopefully some of the other food stalls in the process of opening up will be redeeming."

Where there's smoke, there's fire, and when there's this many negative reviews, they're likely warranted.\n\nThink of amusement park, discount cruise, or stadium captive audience food. As mentioned in other reviews, the prices are atrocious ($21 for a burger and fries). The quality is so bad that the burgers my drunk uncle grills on Memorial Day put the burgers here to shame.\n\nAdditionally, it is a very sterile environment (in part due to a single owner) which I strongly suspect is the same owner of Seoul Food across the street.\n\nIt's a shame that such a promising area is occupied by a clearly short sided cash grab. I echo what another reviewer said, this is a very cynical take on the food hall concept.\n\nSave your money and go anywhere else or be severely disappointed."

The prices of this place are out of control as well. I am amazed they are getting away with charging $21 for a meal when the quality is that bad. Look elsewhere, don't even bother coming here."

I'm sure we will be back because it's in the neighborhood, I'll lower my expectations but hope y'all can do better between now and our next visit..."

Parking is a pain, you have park all way in back where the new soeul food restaurant is. Last night, maybe 4 stalls open. Waiting for other stalls to open..Please note: they just opened last week. The review may change after second visit.... I didn't experience the bar, but that and the wood fire steak restaurant looked the best . I still recommend optimist hall as best choice in town.
