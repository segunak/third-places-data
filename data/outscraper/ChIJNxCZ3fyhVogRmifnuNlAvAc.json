The barista seemed really flustered, behind, and confused so maybe she was new, totally understandable. The man running the register turned back to help her make drinks. A customer went back up to the counter with a drink that he had already drank out of and asked to have caramel added because his drink was wrong. The guy helping the barista took a spoon, put it into the caramel bottle to scrape the caramel out, put it in the customer's used cup to stir it and then put it BACK in the caramel container. I thought surely, they would be taking this back to the dish pit. Nope. They then proceeded to continue using that same caramel for other customer's drinks. If that's what they're doing right in front of customers, I can only imagine what goes on in the kitchen. Super disappointing and gross experience."

I was crestfallen after my favorite local bakery closed (RIP Lincoln's) and trying two allegedly French well-known bakeries in the area that make mediocre pastries at best.\nI had heard about Sunflour for a long time and after finally trying it, I am blown away.  The almond croissant is THE best almond croissant I've ever had in the US and on par with what I've had in France.  The cherry danish was outstanding.  The chocolate croissant is PRECISELY how it's supposed to be: buttery, flaky, and the perfect inclusion of dark chocolate that is not overwhelmingly sweet.  The pistachio macaron was delicious, delicate and not hard (like at one of the aforementioned establishments).  Today I tried their soup of the day which was potato and ham, absolutely delicious.  Their coffee drinks are always perfect.  Every location I've been to is clean, has great music, and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend you try this place."
