As one of their anchor tenants, they're in a prime and accessible location. You can dine inside or at one of the few tables on the patio.\n\nThe food here is delicious. It's prepared by a local chef, Maria Martinez, who is a young phenomenon. The owner Ashley is amazing and the two of them work together to bring some of the most balanced, nutritious, and comforting dishes to life.\n\nService here is also exceptional. One of my favorite things to do when in I'm here is to chat with staff. They are pleasant it feels like you've stopped in your neighborhood corner cafe.\n\nIt honestly gives my Lowcountry vibes with the linen, open and bright vibes.\n\nSometimes, there are out of my favorite things, but I don't hold it against them. They're busy and that's a good thing. I love to see small businesses flourishing and I hope to support them during their tenure Uptown -- and maybe you will too!\n\nFave items: Hugo's Hash, Beattie's Bagel, George's Sammie, the BBQ Chicken Flatbread, and the Shrimp & Grits when they have them! Don't sleep on the Airplane Latte or their chai tea latte options. Always great!"

The atmosphere is beautiful I definitely loved the decor and energy of the place. The lady at the front was so nice and answered all my questions with a smile. I got a coffee and avocado toast it's bacon and cream cheese. For the price I would've liked if they put the cream cheese on my bagel and layered it for me instead of me trying to put it on the outside myself but it was still good so they get 5 stars from me. I definitely will be back. Thank you ladies "
