The owner, Ashley, makes you feel like a friend from the moment you walk through the doors and brings out your order to you directly. Everything from the decor, the furniture, the food and coffees is exquisite. I was in Charlotte for a week while visiting, and came to this cafe almost every morning. Cannot wait to be back!"

The atmosphere is calming, light, and clean. The food is delicious and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. The only downside would be the parking since it's in a busy area so do expect to probably pay for parking."

I think it would be just as good on a croissant. I did have to wait a little longer than I probably wanted to on food but not going to fault them at all for that given they are so new. Highly recommend trying this place out for your next coffee adventure!"
