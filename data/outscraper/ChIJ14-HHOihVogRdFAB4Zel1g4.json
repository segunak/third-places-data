Months later, I've never had an issue. Today the moment I walked in I'm told \"dogs aren't allowed.\" I asked even if we were just ordering and the answer was no. I was just here 2 days ago with my dog and that was not an issue. I was refused service. We never sit and hang out, I always get my coffee while walking and then continue our walk. The staff member wasn't apologetic, empathetic, or anything else. Super disappointing."

Former  Uptown Hospitality /travel industry Concierre/ professional\n\nI realize the recent reviews are good.. and as recent as three days to a month ago....\nI'm confident in my unpopular opinion of this spot. \nReviews don't come in too often .., so that falls under the category of ..,, if you can't  say something nice ....\nFill in the blank....\nLet's go!!!!!!\nDowntown Charlotte ... staying at the beautiful Kimpton Tryon Park....decided to try Waterbean Coffee instead of the local and always present Starbucks\nA Monday morning  between 10:30-11:00 am.\nSpent 11.00 for myself and my sister .\n\nHere are the specifics :\nIf atmosphere is all you're after, this is a beautiful space to just sit and stare or open your laptop.\nSee the pics \nTouring, visiting, or investigating the downtown area , in search of any level of warmth, comfort or friendliness from staff???\nNope.\n\n*THE HUMAN\nstill desires... warmth. A little bit. - me\n\nMy sister wasn't sure what to order. She just knew she wanted a coffee... a little sweet... a little strong....\nIt was obvious when ordering ... no guidance from staff....i was aware.\nJust watched . Listened.\nOh! Also BARELY  an AUDIBLE GOOD MORNING\nThree  staff members.ALL LOOKING DIRECTLY AT US.\nOk. I'm super low maintenance.... So- I don't need all that extra ness...just  a fresh cup of black coffee\n\nOk just don't  say anything .\nMaybe that would have been better.\n\nCoffee and kindness matched.\n\nClearly it was ( my coffee) whatever was left from the early morning .... Which is fine.... BUT. It also tasted like it . It was just a coffee- black.\nUnfresh. Coffee and staff kindness matched. served with a bland , cold, \"there you go...\"  feeling and placement on the counter .\n\nI was not pleased.\nI drank it purely because ... caffeine\n\nDear Mr. Or Miss management: it is unacceptable in this hour of \" Google reviews\" for  staff to not make sure that a customer is ordering what they really want , as well as receive guidance in placing their order when it is perceived by staff that the customer may not be knowledgeable about how menu items are prepared .\nOr.... Does staff have any idea how to anticipate or perceive customer needs?\nAnd that's more than just showing what types of milk are offered..,,\nThere was no line, no wait..  but no warmth or friendliness...., just a level of \" nicety\".,,\nBTW I DID SAY good morning loud enough for all three to hear.\n\nMy coffee was unfresh.\nI waited to see if staff would be a little more informative in receiving my sister's order.... So that she gets her money's worth....isnt that important ?\n\nMinimal information given  we do see now coconut milk is  not offered....ok... since the lady turned the little  sign around for us to \" see\"\n\nMessage: if you don't like people in the morning - don't work at a coffee spot\n\nMessage again:   with Starbucks just around the block, up the street  and  around the corner  , and then again around another corner ....my thought is ...this is just a coffee spot. No difference made. No Personality.\n\nI'll go get a Venti for  $90.oo next time .\n\nMy sister and I sat there to drink our coffee\nShe didn't have what she expected . We made it work.\n\nThis was our first visit.\n\nAfter we sat there and I did my photo log.., we noticed quite a lot of whispering ...\n\nThen .....as we left, One of them smiled !\nSMILED and  said have a nice day ..,,\n\nMy first thought: did she poison us?\nClearly ready for us to leave.\n\nWhy did that have to be the impression given?\n\nIt would have felt better upon arrival ... the smile.... The smile wouldn't have hurt upon our arrival.\nWe did notice that the two gentlemen who came In after received quite different greetings and service than we did....\nOh.... So that's a latte!!!\n\nJust put a sign on the door that only welcomes ... \" your regulars\"\n\nI'll spend 10.00 with the siren.\n\nThat's my review and thank you for reviewing it\n\nPeep the pics\n\nLet's Go Eat!!!\nItsMeStef"

Inside was nicely dimmed but not dark, which made it perfectly relaxing.\n\nWhen I walked in, I wasn't greeted, but the workers seemed annoyed that I had come. I ordered food and waited 20 minutes because they forgot. I was pretty upset.\n\nAfter I reminded her about my food, she apologized, made it, and her attitude was fantastic. She talked more, and I could tell she was sincerely sorry.\n\nWhen I got my sandwich, it so so delicious. It was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.\n\nI'm from Cleveland, so I can't visit as much as I want, but I'll be looking forward to revisiting when I'm in Charlotte.\n\nIf this review was helpful, please leave a thumbs up."

Personally, I believe the taste is worth it.\n\nThis location has a wide selection of teas and coffees, and are happy to accommodate for any customer with a food allergy by substituting ingredients, and is set in a very convenient location. I would rate this location 9/10 stars if I could. Great experience!"
