After being notified at the register that I have accumulated points for spending $$ there... I could get a free drink. Register employee said to me \"your drinks will be ( over there ) \" pointing at the food station. Patiently waiting 20 min , having to be the last one served in that little waiting que with others I politely asked Casey if that was my order , she was the one standing there at the station and had just finished my order.\nSince  I only saw the pomegranate lemonade I had purchased... and not a cup for my earned rewards freebie\n\nShe said \"That's all\", I said well can I please get my free drink that I had rewards for as well and she looked at me funny : said nothing: I repeated .. then she reached out and grabbed the cup just holding it , instead of reaching out , providing it / saying I'm sorry  would be just too much .. but my problem is she proceeded to turn to a customer that had walked by to wait and laughed at me as I did not have a lid ( they are behind register) and had me put on a soup lid.\n\nAfter being embarrassed.. and spending my lunch hour being disrespectful .. back to work I had to go, before leaving I spoke to her and she jokingly laughed and said well can I get you your lid for you now ...\n\nAll I asked was please don't disrespect any more customers today over a drink because it was rude and I felt hurt and shaking to a point of anxiety creeping in.\n\n50$ ain't worth that with that type of service\nDisrespectful.. in my professional opinion SHES NOT MANAGER MATERIAL.\n\nGood luck and hope you all don't get disrespected when asking for your free drink cup by her\n\nThanks so much Casey, love wins\nOh and my soup lid worked extra good\n\nGenius!\n\nWish you the best\n\nAngelika"

She didn't wash her hands, put on gloves, put her hair up or even clock in, but proceeded to handle my food and put it in the broiler.  I am appalled and thoroughly disappointed that the person this young lady was speaking to didn't correct her as she was the manager on duty. Please do better and think about your guests well being.

I had to go back and asked for my sandwich I ordered. The guy said oh I was wondering why this sandwich was here.  Now that pissed me off.  Then I get home I was supposed to have broccoli and cheese soup. This dude gave me vegetable noodle soup. Now what in the world was going on in the back. There was about 5 people standing around the counter. At least one of the 5 should've gotten my order right.  This is ridiculous and poor customer service for the inflated price I paid.

I drive about 35 minutes just to come to this Panera because of their service. Ever since the company got the new toasted french baguette sandwiches, most locations will not substitute other sandwich breads for the french baguette on normal sandwiches (not sure why?). I've always ordered the same thing for years because of my allergies: the bacon turkey bravo with french baguette instead of the tomato basil bread. The manager (who placed my order) was very nice and even wrapped my pager so there wouldn't be any cross contamination on that either. She made sure the cooks behind the counter knew about my allergies and made me feel like I was in safe hands.\n\nOnly downside I had about the experience was the lack of clean tables. Seemed like all the tables had crumbs on them; however, with how busy they were, it was to be expected."

I've mentioned to management that forgetting barbecue sauce on the barbecue chicken sandwich is kind of a key component, and frustrating. They took the feedback and my next sandwich was fine. I recently ordered a steak and cheddar as well as a Greek salad to go after ordering breakfast. They forgot to add cheddar on the steak and cheddar, and yes the meat was skimpy, but I more care that the two ingredients IN THE NAME of the sandwich are included. The dressing cup was also not closed so by the time I got to eat the salad at work later that day everything was soaked. (I had trusted the order was correct and packaged with care, my mistake) I'm used to them regularly forgetting ingredients but they never make up for it or offer to redo it correctly. I hate ordering rapid pick up just have to unbox and unwrap things before I leave just to make sure.  I definitely won't pay for a premium sandwich there again. Sad really. Fortunately there's another Panera a couple miles up the interstate"

She just looked at me and pointed at an order that was not mine \" and said is that yours?\" I said no. She finally moved from behind the counter and asked me for  my name. Which should have done in the first place. Instead of just pointing at a random order and guessing. My order was done  it was just sitting on a shelf for who knows how long . She just handed to me and didn't even apologize to me for my wait. I feel like if I wanted to go inside to get my order I would have done that the first time.  I will never again come to the Rock hill Panera Bread. The hot chocolate was also nasty."

The first day we called 4 times and not one time was the phone answered.  We then drove to the location to order in the store and found out they were out of all 3 items we were looking for.  The second time we tried to order they picked up the first time and then put us on hold for 15 minutes before we finally hung up.  We called back 4 more times and the phone was never answered.  This is horrible customer service and we will not longer be visiting a Panera bread.  We have been customers for a very long time but will be no longer."
