You can tell they take great pride in sourcing organic, high-quality beans.\n\nDon't miss out on their pastries, especially the honeycomb! It's perfectly sweet, flaky, and pairs so well with their one-of-a-kind Adani Chai. Speaking of the chai, it's an absolute must-try--rich, aromatic, and unlike anything else you'll find in the city.\n\nIf you're a coffee or tea lover, Qahwah House is a spot you'll keep coming back to.

I truly don't think I have ever tasted anything quite as good as that pistachio latte. We both couldn't get over that one! The brown sugar latte was also fantastic - I tasted lots of warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg - and the honeycomb came out warm and drizzled with honey... holy moly. Unbelievable. The bread reminded me of a yeast roll, and several pockets of it had a cream cheese mixture that's tartness was perfectly balanced with the sweet honey.\n\nWe already can't wait to come back. Such an incredible new addition to Plaza Midwood!"

The customer service is very warm and friendly. The overall design and layout of the shop is spacious and absolutely beautiful. This is a great place to enjoy yourself and make great memories.\n\nI can be a bit anxious socially, and I was initially worried when I first entered the shop due to its high volume of customers at the time. I sat at the coffee bar with a close friend, and despite our initial worries, we spent about three hours there! You can tell that this space is focused on creating and housing a genuine, authentic community of kind people.\n\nI ordered the Jubani blend and honeycomb pastry, and they were divine! So far, those are my favorite items. Honorable mentions from others who've ordered here include the Yemeni Tea and Adeni Chai--both are delicious! I look forward to trying more of their menu items."

I like that they have regular espresso and cappuccino drinks along with Middle Eastern specialties. I tried the Jubani with evaporated milk. It was absolutely delicious. I also had the honeycomb and the Sabaya pastries. Both were delicious. The employees were very friendly as well. I thought the prices were fair. Will absolutely go back again!"

Their unique blend of spices is something you won't find anywhere else. I also loved their pastries and snacks, which paired wonderfully with the coffee.\n\nThe staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to ensure that every guest has a great experience. It's clear they take pride in what they do, and it shows in every detail.\n\nIf you're in Charlotte and looking for a place with incredible coffee, a great vibe, and outstanding service, Qahwa House is a must-visit. I can't wait to go back!"
