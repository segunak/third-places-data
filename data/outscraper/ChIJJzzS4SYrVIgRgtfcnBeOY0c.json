An Italian donut. A cannoli. 2 croissants. 2 cheesecakes. Here was our review!\n\nMy wife loved the Italian donut, my son and I did not love it so much. It's more like a bread product rather than a donut. Wife came in at 4.5/5. My son came in at 3/5. I came in at 2.8/5\n\nThe bomboloni. WOW. Just wow. We all agreed 5/5. That coupled with the latte. What a way to start your Sunday. I've not had a donut like this. I had it stuffed with vanilla custard and it was not too sweet. Perfect amount of sweet level.\n\nThe cannoli. Let me preface this by saying our family doesn't love cannolis. We got a cannoli and oh my good lord, it was AMAZING. A cooler cannoli filling with a fresh crispy crust. My son came in at 4.5/5 I came in at 4.9/5 and my wife came in at 4.5/5. (Again this is from a family of non cannoli eaters)\n\nChocolate croissant. Soft, warm, chocolate filled. We really enjoyed this one. 4.5/5 across the board.\n\nWe got full and haven't tried the pumpkin cheesecake of the raspberry cheesecake yet, or the pistachio croissant.\n\nMy son gives holy cannoli 4.7/5. I give it 4.9/5 my wife gives 4.8! Definitely go enjoy some delicious treats and great coffee!"
