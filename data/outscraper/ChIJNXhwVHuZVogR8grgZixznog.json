I have also experienced multiple times that the cashier will handle money with gloves on and use those same gloves to grab bread/food. I personally ask for them to change gloves before handling my food. This should be the standard. Why isn't the guy that is preparing the food not asked to cover his overgrown beard/mustache? Lastly, I questioned if they are making enough cinnamon rolls. It almost never fails that no matter what time of the day it is, they are almost always out. Even at 8:00 in the morning they are always out. My biggest concern are the insanitary practices."

The next thing I noticed is that the bacon was missing on one of the half sandwich I ordered, I needed to ask for a remake. The croissant came out cold and isn't worth paying $3 for. This reminded me of how nasty the coffee at Panera is and am not coming back."

I then received an email notification saying your food has been delivered. Checked my front door no food! I even had my daughter go check my neighbors front doors no food! So I called & got in touch with the manager this guy is the definition of what a manager should be! At first he had trouble finding my order that I placed which made me a little frustrated at first because the charge had already been debited from my card. So the manager says no worries I'll fix this, so he finds my order apologizes for the non delivery order & advises me that the next available time for delivery is another 2 hours away but to avoid me having to wait another 2 hours he will personally bring it out to me himself! Holy cow! I thought excellent customer service like this no longer exist! He brings it out knocks on the door & personally hands me our food! & The food was still smoking hot almost burned my tongue on the soup! & He wouldn't even except a tip! Only thing I regret is that I didn't get his name! Great deeds like this shouldn't go unnoticed!"

Then when I asked for a cup to get a fountain drink they gave me the wrong size lid and when I went back up to get a different lid they gave me it without gloves. They also forgot to give me my coffee I also ordered!!!!! After I left in a bad mood I realize that they didn't even give me butter and made my order wrong!!!

Wasn't sure what to expect with it being my first time at this one, but I was delightfully pleased. The food came out fast. We usually have a semi complicated order with our sandwiches but the kitchen executed it perfectly. I could hear the food runner and the kitchen communicating effectively and that's what makes a smooth running machine out of a business. Thanks for having us and thanks for the delicious lunch. Kudos!"
