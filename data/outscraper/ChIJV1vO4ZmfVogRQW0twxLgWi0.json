It honestly felt like discrimination, I was appalled at the attitude the manager had with us and she proceeded to walk out and lock the doors before closing hours.

Staff is super nice, and you can tell they work hard. However, my iced coffee has been missing the syrup 3 times in the last month - once in person and twice for mobile order. I caught it the first 2 times and they made it right.  The 3rd time I was rushed and didn't catch it.  One time, it had regular milk instead of cream and one time my mobile was missing the snack box, but not as much of a concern I suppose because mistakes happen...it's just the pattern that is taking extra time to have my orders corrected. I have tried calling the store multiple times with no answer to notify the staff so that they can be aware and make any improvements necessary, but cannot get an answer. If someone can address my concern from the this review, I would appreciate it and will be happy to change it to 5 stars with a glaring review."

Like YEAH, my drink I ordered 10 minutes ago that no one has even bothered to make yet. I'm an avid Starbucks go-er and this was by far my worst experience.

Unreal how utterly brainwashed some people are. Never returning, if it wasn't the ONLY coffee place open before 6 am never would have set foot in the most ungodly uncomfortable coffee shop that's 2000 square feet you're not allowed to sit in unless you're in a biohazard suit. Literally clown world. I wish 0 stars was an actual review. And for God sake THE COFFEE ISNT EVEN VERY GOOD!"

I  have always ordered the same drink: a grande pink drink with no ice. Today when I picked up my usual order, the cup was half full. I asked why and was told that it was because they have premeasured amounts for a grande drink with ice, and they refused to add more drink to the cup..... I paid almost $4.82 for a half full drink. Unbelievable! I have never had this happen to me before and they told me that they have \"always enforced this policy.\" Definitely won't be back to this location - sad."

These Starbucks employees go above and beyond for their customers and it shows through the many familiar faces that I see returning to their store.

The manager of this store has done a great job but if it weren't for their employees, this store would not run so smoothly.

            "review_text": "This is my favorite Starbucks in town in terms of layout, atmosphere, and design. The service however is inexcusable and probably the worst I have experienced. The employees aren't being trained for efficiency and are always slow-moving and seem to do tasks in odd orders. I notice that when making drinks they won't set them out as they are finished, but instead hoard a line of finished drinks on the back bar until they finish everything and then move them all to the counter. WHY?! It's frustrating to stand at the bar waiting when you know your drink is ready, but nobody is handing it over. Often the employees are swinging a towel around laughing and chatting (and not working). I ordered an ice coffee (black... easy) and then ordered a refill of the same thing an hour later. The first time my coffee was poured, but sat on the back counter for over 5 minutes while the barista finished other drinks. Eventually the manager came over and asked what I was waiting for and I pointed at my finished drink and said I was merely waiting for my drink to be within arms reach. Absurd. When I got my refill, and I remind you it is simply dispensing pre-made coffee and adding ice (a 15 second effort), my cup sat empty on the bar while three employees laughed and talked. The employee responsible for making my drink decided to take this opportunity to very slowly show another employee how to make a shaken tea. Why wouldn't that employee just pour the 15 second coffee and get me on my way before starting this process? I checked the time on my sticker to see how long I waited and it was 8 minutes and 15 seconds. For an iced coffee! and no it wasn't because the store was busy. The employees are just slow and have no multi-tasking or time-management skills. Having been to probably 80 different Starbucks stores hundreds of times over the last 15 years I can't believe how frustrating it is to experience a store that runs as poorly as this one all without apology. Eight minutes doesn't sound like a long time, but when you are just standing, silently staring at your drink and not being able to take it, it feels like an eternity. This Starbucks makes me wish I could just walk around the counter, pick up the cup, pour coffee to the line, add ice, and walk out. It's not hard. As I sit here I'm watching customers with grumpy faces stand with their hands on their hips rolling their eyes at the employees doing anything other than work."

They have unprofessional customer service, and immature behaviour towards customers who were never rude to the baristas in the first place.  They should not bully customers, and they don't deserve that treatment regardless.  They don't see that customers like this Trump supporter, still do business with Starbucks, and just there to get a cup of coffee.\n\nI don't support the actions of these rude Starbucks baristas, not only how they treat the customer with the Trump t-shirt, but it shows a very bad impression of their service, ruining Starbucks business, and they clearly don't care for it.\n\n#coffeenotstarbucksbaristabullies\n#stopstarbucksbaristabullies"

This one wins for atmosphere: both the inimitable building and the throngs of patrons who obviously love it there and stay.\n\nIt was an awkwardly chili morning in Charlotte when we came, but to an appropriate place it was. Plenty, albeit already occupied, seating throughout the building, as well as comfortable outside furniture reserved for those warmer days when one orders an iced chai latte instead of one extra hot with two sleeves.\n\nParking was a bit congested out back, but like the inside seats, there's plenty reserved for Starbucks if only less people came... a good problem to have, I guess."
