My mom and I had a whole milk pumpkin vanilla latte that puts any option at Starbucks to shame! The vibe is relaxed but modern and they have great indoor and outdoor seating for patrons that want to stay a while. Will definitely add this to our list of regular coffee shops. Highly highly recommend!"

I happened to come across Allegiance coffee when I was at a yard sale across the street.  I thought I'd give it a try and I am so happy I did.  It is a small gem in Concord located off Old Charlotte Road.  If you are reading this, I suggest saving it on your GOOGLE maps under \"want to go.\"  It is a must-try!\nIt has a warm and welcoming atmosphere and the best coffee!  There is plenty of seating inside and out for those of you who'd like to hang out.  They also have a drive-through.  The employees are friendly and accommodating.  They listen to how you like your coffee or what you want in it and create the perfect drink.  I generally order the pumpkin breve, which has half and half instead of milk to give it a creamier texture.  The espresso is smooth and flavorful, and the pumpkin flavor is perfect, not too sweet.  It is a real treat to be able to stop by in the morning and enjoy the best cup of coffee in Concord."

The notification was a tiny hand written note facing away from the register almost intentionally placed to not be noticed. It had to be pointed out because it is not obvious at all. It's really the audacity for me especially considering the cost in the first place. It's insulting. When I called my credit card company they referred me to the following policy.\n\nAmerican Express\tOnly government agencies, educational institutions, utility companies and rental establishments can charge credit card convenience fees.\n\nI know it's a small fee but just the audacity to get that last little cash grab that most never even notice.

How do you overcome some of that? Atmosphere and service and variety. I wanted to sit and relax a bit with a pastry also and aside from being alone, service, seating and baked goods is extremely limited and so unprofessional. The woman and girl at the basic makeshift counter were sad looking and not cheerful and were not welcoming. It's like a mom & daughter are running on a shoestring and operating off a home kitchen counter. I was handed a carton of cream at counter then go to another counter to get sugar. Cute clean interior but small. Padded benches are really awkward and if someone is sitting even on one end it's weird for another to sit there. Very awkward and super unenviting. Its quiet as a library and the few others talking quietly felt weird. I think some light quiet jazz or folk or some kind of music would make a BIG...no, H.U.G.E difference. Place is in an old tired neighborhood that isn't enviting, so the draw there is limited with that too. Honestly, without upping the game and changing the seating layout and being more cheerful, this place just isn't going to last long."

The staff are always greeting you with a smile and are timely when making your coffee. This place is also an awesome Christian place to go study your Bible!! The owners are awesome too!

The drip was flat so not sure if the brew temperature is low or it's just under extracted. Wife's latte didn't taste like anything either. It's great they roast their own beans, but there's more to do for me to stop going to my usual local spot.\nStart making your own latte syrups and get a scale so you can measure it out each time for consistency. This works much better than pumps of syrup from a tub. Check on the ratio of water/coffee or the grind size on the drip. It wasn't bitter/over extracted, but was very flat.\nNot sure if you're on the Odeko app, but that would be helpful as well."

Unless I want some chocolate after notes. Than a small bit of cream is requsted..  Is this review to long.... sorry but I have to! I'm a foodie.

The sticky buns and the pop tarts are really good, however would have been so much better had they been served warm. Not sure if thats not possible or it just wasnt offered, but I did not see an appliance available to heat them. The cold brew was just ok and the wife had the light blend drip coffee, which see said was very good. Overall, our experience was good and suggest checking it out."
