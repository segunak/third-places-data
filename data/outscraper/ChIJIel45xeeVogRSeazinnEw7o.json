I wondered if the library would return my money or if I had to dispute the charges through my bank - simple question. She was dismissive of me, refused to answer my question claiming she \"doesn't know anything about the printers\". Her tone  and attitude were condescending and disrespectful, I cannot stress how unprofessional she was. There are kinder ways to speak to people. People who do not enjoy helping others should not be stationed at the front desk of a public library."

I refused to interact with her- never said a word.  My book was on hold, no one was even around & I was in/out (checking myself out w the check-out station within 3 mins or less). She put herself so close to me & harassed me the whole process through- I minded my business, continued with entering my info to scan my book out & promptly walked out (all right at the front door).  Unbelievable & ridiculous.  This whole city has gone down the tubes- very sad to see!!  This whole incident caused me to never leave my house for even groceries again- only would order online.
