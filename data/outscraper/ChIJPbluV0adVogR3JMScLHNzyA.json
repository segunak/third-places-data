Every time I order a food item it seems that people that order about 4-5 behind me get their items before I do and then I have to ask to get my item almost every single time. There's never a \"I'm sorry, have a good day or a thank you\" from certain people working there. At this point the personality from the person made me decide not to go back. There really needs to be a better flow or system in place. One of the other customers got so confused cause we didn't even know who's food item was who's so we had to open it up and check. Sadly won't be returning but hopefully this issue gets better. Service and personality go such a long way!"

Every time we have been in since then has just gone progressively down hill. The coffee is still pretty decent but the wait continues to get longer and longer it seems. They only ever have 1 barista making drinks and 1 other employee taking orders and making food and it's just too busy for them to keep up with. There does not seem to be any system in place for mobile ordering, they keep the drinks behind the bar so you have to request your mobile order and thus still wait in line to ask for it and then have an awkward conversation with the employee at the counter when it's not ready after you ordered it 15 minutes ago. The staff is all very friendly and doing their best but they need more help!"
