They have created a chic, inviting and chill environment with the layout and decor.

My first experience was a cold egg sandwich, but ever since it's been steaming.  The Chili Verde wrap is a fun addition that brings some flavor to breakfast.\nI think everything is moving in the right direction and this will continue to be in my rotation of morning delights."

            "review_text": "The rise of the Coffee Republic began in the shadow of a once-dominant force: the Tea Kingdom. For centuries, the world had been steeped in tea culture, where a single monarch and an elite class of tea sommeliers dictated the brewing methods and flavors enjoyed by the people. But discontent simmered beneath the surface. The common coffee farmers, tired of the rigid traditions and the overwhelming dominance of tea, sought a new system--one where every coffee drinker had a voice.\n\nIn a bold move, the coffee farmers, roasters, and baristas overthrew the last Tea King, spilling his finest Darjeeling and dismantling the monarchy. In its place, they established the Coffee Republic, a system where cafe owners, bean merchants, and skilled baristas could all participate in the governance of their coffee trade. Instead of a single ruler, power was shared among elected coffee consuls and a council of esteemed roasters, ensuring that no single blend dominated the market.\n\nThe early years of the Coffee Republic were filled with struggle. Rival cafe syndicates often clashed, and there were constant battles over the best brewing techniques. But through perseverance, innovation, and the unwavering belief that coffee was meant to be enjoyed by all, the republic flourished.\n\nExpanding beyond its original cafes, the Coffee Republic pushed into new territories, offering superior roasting methods and advanced espresso technology. Over time, its influence spread, and coffee drinkers from all regions embraced the new order. Though the road was filled with challenges, the rise of the Coffee Republic marked a turning point in history, ensuring that never again would the world be ruled by a single tea-drinking elite. Instead, a new age of rich, bold coffee had begun."

There's never a \"I'm sorry, have a good day or a thank you\" from certain people working there. At this point the personality from the person made me decide not to go back. There really needs to be a better flow or system in place. One of the other customers got so confused cause we didn't even know who's food item was who's so we had to open it up and check. Sadly won't be returning but hopefully this issue gets better. Service and personality go such a long way!"

There does not seem to be any system in place for mobile ordering, they keep the drinks behind the bar so you have to request your mobile order and thus still wait in line to ask for it and then have an awkward conversation with the employee at the counter when it's not ready after you ordered it 15 minutes ago.

When her break ended she walked behind the counter and asked the other employee if she could trade shifts with her next weekend. Several people were waiting on their orders and people were waiting to order. She finally started helping and did not wash her hands. She was not friendly. She didn't seem like she cared. The quiche was runny. The cinnamon twist was hard, dry, and tasteless. I could not even taste the coffee  in the morning buzz latte. I only tasted milk. I was so disappointed. I won't be back."
