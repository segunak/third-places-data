After few more sips I had sharp pain in my stomach & started throwing up. I've never had such a violent reaction to any beverage before, I think either match, ice or almond milk or all were contaminated. I felt better after throwing up all of the matcha I drank from them."

Great cold brew and amazing lattes along with the city's most efficient, friendly and remarkably well managed baristas. I would be remiss in not extolling the merits of their seasonal drinks, my favorite was the refreshing Sunrise from the Summer menu, which had to be created by a beverage genius. So, take the over-the-street walkway or the escalator to the brightly lit and inviting Night Swim Coffee in the One Wells Fargo building, you won't regret it."
