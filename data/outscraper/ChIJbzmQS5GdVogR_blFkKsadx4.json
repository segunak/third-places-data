After experiencing the coffee, employees, and atmosphere why would anyone choose Starbucks!? The quality is incredible and the store is super cute and cozy.\nSure, there's not the convenience of a drive thru but the baristas here are very quick and efficient so you won't be waiting long for your first sip! Everything tastes fantastic! HIGHLY recommend!"
