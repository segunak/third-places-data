I asked him about it not having the nitro foam you would normally get and he said that's the way they serve it.  Took it to go and ended up throwing about half the drink away.

The coffee is not the best, as other reviews have said, but I don't mind -- I like most coffee.\n\nUnfortunately, I've stopped visiting Mugs even though I live 2 minutes away. The problem is one barista (or friend of the baristas?) who hangs out there in the afternoons and is EXTREMELY LOUD. It's clear that people are there working or doing homework, but she can be heard at every corner of the establishment. I can even hear her when I wear my noise-cancelling earbuds. She chats with the baristas at the bar, cusses excessively, and talks negatively about her friends or her boyfriend. I can't get any work done there because I can't hear my own thoughts. Very sad to have to move on from Mugs."

It's a great shop to sit alone and catch up on some work in the company of strangers or to hang out with a group of friends. The staff is always super friendly and the drink menu is pretty extensive. You can get your favorite hot or cold drink in any flavor and they have a good selection of milk alternatives."

I try to avoid going to Starbucks as much as possible, so I am always on the hunt for a convenient place to get a cup of coffee, work or meet colleagues and potentially get a bite to eat, and this coffee shop checks all of those boxes.\n\nI tried this location since it is centrally located between downtown and a number of other areas in Charlotte, so I am able to meet people from other areas of the city here without either of us having to drive too far (I am centrally located just outside of uptown).\n\nThe coffee is significantly better than what you might find at a Starbucks (though I do go to Starbucks as well when I have to). The staff is always very friendly and they will even take the time to educate you on things you might want to know when purchasing an item. For example, every time I purchase a coffee, they let me know that I can get one complimentary refill included in a purchase. While some coffee shops may do this, most won't proactively let you know since I assume they are trying to keep costs low.\n\nFor someone who loves coffee, this makes me more apt to purchase a larger size, knowing I will at least get my money's worth, especially considering the quality and taste of the coffee here is superior to other places I've tried.\n\nI have also ordered food here while working and it is surprisingly good, especially for a coffee shop. They serve fresh croissants with chicken salad in it, which was very well done. The chicken salad was fresh (not frozen) and the croissant was well-made...crispy and flaky with a soft warm center.  Whenever I eat at Starbucks (which is extremely rare, mainly only in airports when I have limited time to get food and coffee), they warm up the spinach feta wrap from what was clearly made a while ago and is probably filled with numerous preservatives. Though it tastes okay, it is not something I would crave, while the chicken salad sandwich at Mugs is actually worth going back for.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to someone who is looking for an alternative to Starbucks with better coffee, better food, good service and a comfortably working or meeting environment."
