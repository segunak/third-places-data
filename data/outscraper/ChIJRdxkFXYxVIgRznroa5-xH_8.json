We had a great time and look to be back since we can get a nice little morning date in before work."

Both sandwiches came with a bag of chips. We didn't order drinks. We ordered one medium ice cream cone.  Maybe we made the wrong food choices, but we wouldn't order these again.  The service was very good and friendly.  I will say $50.00 for this order seemed extremely high for what we received.  The ice cream cone was 2 scoops and large, but right at $8.00 seemed a bit much.  I think we should of just ordered coffee.  It seems that is what most people get here.  We had already gotten coffee at a place on Main Street which was really good, so we skipped the drinks here.  We wanted to love this place and it wasn't crowded at lunchtime.  Unfortunately,  we probably wouldn't go here again, except to try their coffee."

It's smooth and tasty. I don't usually like my coffee bitter, so the white mocha is perfect for me. They can make it extra sweet but it was a bit too sweet.\n\nChai: Any time my wife talks about chai, she is comparing it to her favorite chai from college. She compared it to that chai! I even liked it and I don't like chai!\n\nFood: My wife I have tried the breakfast sandwiches only, and they were pretty good. I had a bacon, egg, and cheese on sourdough. She had a turkey, egg, and cheese on GLUTEN FREE BREAD! I don't know if they use separate grills, so there might be cross contamination, but my wife had no issues with it.\n\nAtmosphere: The location in a restored gas station is genius! The soft chairs right in the entrance are perfect and there is outside seating when the weather is good. This place is popular, so do be prepared for a possible long wait if you go in during peak hours\n\nStaff: They are fairly friendly. They normally have a smile, repeat your order back to you, get your order to you quickly, and check on you if things are taking too long.\n\nThey consistently stay open and make quality drinks and food. This is the best coffee in Union County and the best chai in the South!"

I ordered Choco Cookie frappe and it was good, Thanksgiving sandwich was ok but bread was burnt for my liking, but edible. Now the stuff wasn't very welcoming, so as prices on food and drinks. We ended up paying 50$ for two sandwiches with processed deli meat and drinks, absolutely ridiculous. They don't offer variety of milk so be aware of it if. Parking limited, you have to park behind restaurant on town parking.\n\nExtra info to my review: Had lunch in Dilworth area in Charlotte, order of chicken sandwich with real meat and lamb burger with two coffees cost us 40$ tip included. Place called Kid Cashew."

Oscar said they have different flavors each day; we bought Washed and Bourbon whole beans today, and he gave us a sample bag of the Gesha to try also.

People open coffee places because it's cheaper than starting other businesses and many times they don't know what they are doing. Let's take as an example their \"honey lavender\" flavored drink. If you put a whole ounce of the lavender  it tastes like floor cleaner. One is only supposed to put a touch in. Well this place doesn't care and they just dump an ounce in. When I went to order something different, even though the mistake was theirs, they let me order another nine dollar drink. Also when I was sitting down and the new drink was delivered, I asked that they take the old drink away. The server looked at me like I was an idiot, and spoke to like I was an idiot saying \"the trash is right there, you can do it yourself\". I asked the server if I was supposed to dump this whole drink in the trash and then it would leak all over the floor when they emptied it, and there was a sink in back. The server took it with a huff.\n\nThis is my second visit to this place and each time I left having spent way too much money for a below average product and service. It does look cool though, and things that look cool sometimes aren't cool."

They have a great selection of coffee, pastries, ice cream and sandwiches.\n\nWe came here for sandwiches and coffees on a cute couples date.\n\nTried The Little Havana sandwich. This one turned out to be my favorite.\n\nWe also tried the Queso Planche which comes in second place.\n\nThird favorite we tried was the Thanksgiving sandwich. Very nice combo of flavors.\n\nLast thing was the new breakfast sandwich which has bacon, egg, and cheese but that wasn't as exciting as their other creations.\n\nWe got sugar free vanilla and hazelnut syrups in our iced lattes with almond milk. Those were very nice. Great amount of coffee, milk, and sweetness. Nice blend of flavors.\n\nWe also got a handful of pastries to test out and see what was good. I recommend trying any of them and enjoying them all or come by a few times to try something new every time.\n\nLoved the inside vibe and some cool things in here to see.\n\nService was exceptional as well!"

They're kind of a one stop shop, having ice cream, sandwiches, pastries, specialty coffees, waffles, etc..I ordered a plain waffle with just butter and syrup (I wasn't feeling too adventurous that day) and The Moma ordered a Strawberry-Banana-Ice cream-Waffle confectionary delight. My waffle was delightfully golden and crispy on the outside and so fluffy on the inside!! Moma was making sounds I wasn't old enough to hear and then...I took a sip of my coffee and it was pure Heaven!!! I will be back again and again and..."

This coffee shop is hands down the best in town thanks to Oscar's expertise in the coffee industry, superb brewing techniques, and the exceptional quality of the coffee beans used at this location.

Regardless, things have since gotten better, and the coffee continues to be absolutely worth the wait!"
