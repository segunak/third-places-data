The reason this library doesn't get 5 starts is because I am a teen and I was sitting in the teen section, I'm also a university student but I'm not overage for the teen section. A young white lady employee came up to me and asked if I was a student, I said yes because I am, then she asked what school I went to and I told her. She automatically assumed I was too old to be in the section instead of asking me my age or for ID she asked me to move into a study room. I immediately felt disappointed because she didn't do her due diligence and I'm just trying to get my work done. Not all college student are 20-21-22. Some of us are 17&18. At first I was going to just go to the study room but then I decided I should just leave because I no longer felt welcome. I should have asked her name but I didn't. I will not be returning to this location."
