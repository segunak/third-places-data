Every season they create specialty caffeinated beverages that are out of this world. The best is the Ube latte that is a specialty drink of the summer. But it's not just about the coffee; their food selection is equally impressive. From savory sandwiches to delectable pastries, every bite is a delight. Some of the best casual food in Charlotte. I highly suggest the avocado toast- they make such a simple dish a culinary masterpiece.\n\nWhat sets this place apart, though, is its ambiance. With cozy nooks and ample workspace, it's the perfect spot to hunker down and get some work done. The atmosphere is buzzing yet relaxed, making it equally suitable for a solo brainstorming session or a casual catch-up with friends.\n\nThe staff deserves a special mention as well. Friendly, attentive, and passionate about their craft, they elevate the experience to another level.\n\nWhether you're a coffee aficionado, a foodie, or just someone in search of a welcoming environment to spend some time, this coffee shop ticks all the boxes. Five stars all the way!"

The baristas remember you, they welcome you and the coffee tastes so good! It's such a great spot to either go by yourself or a group of friends. Love it!"

It's got this blend of cool music and a welcoming vibe that just works.\n\nPlus, the space is designed in such a way that you won't struggle to find a good spot to hunker down, whether you're diving into work or just catching up with someone.\n\nIn terms of parking - it's surprisingly easy, which is a rare find for being only 5 mins outside the city.\n\nI haven't been on the weekend yet to see how busy it is, but I can honestly see Coffee at Station West becoming my new go-to weekday coffee spot. Definitely worth checking out."

I loved their food items also. Very fresh product and a loving vibe and aesthetic. I got to watch; families come into their private rooms for traditional Saturday breakfast meals, business women and men meet, and Bible studies take place here. An amazing place you should stop by.

(And I have to try the food one of these next times).\n\nUPDATE: if I could give this place SIX stars I would. I just love this place. The people are so friendly and welcoming. I don't even want to go to other coffee shops anymore. You guys have done something great here. Oh and the food is amazing. I love the porridge. The maple scone was delish.

We even had the opportunity to meet Toby, the owner, and were in Awe of his 30-plus years of experience in the business. The tour included experiencing coffee and the inclusivity of those who make it all come to life. This is not your everyday coffee experience; it's more like a spiritual journey of belonging and being proud to be a part of such a fantastic community. You will not be disappointed. Rest assured.\n\nThere is also a nice view of uptown as you sip your special cup of have around a fire pit outdoors."

Creative touches dominate the interior space, with ample space inside to spend time and get some work done, and there's plenty of parking.  There's also a great outdoor patio nearing completion which has great views of uptown.  The Batchmaker bakery is just across the patio.  An all-around solid spot!"

My oatmilk latte was perfection, the atmosphere was serene and calming and I got a tour of the entire facility from Luke and Jazz. They roast, pack and ship their beans right from the Berryhill location. This is a must stop if you're in the area!"

The energy in the shop is wonderful and they work hard to be inclusive in their hiring process at every level.  The story behind all of their artwork is lovely and I recommend asking about it while you're there.  Everything from paintings to the art on their coffee beans to the rugs in the shop have a story.  My roommate and I were lucky enough to get a tour and all I can say is that we will definitely be back often.  It's a truly wonderful place and I'm excited about seeing it in all its glory when it has a public grand opening.  OH and the event space in the back!  It has a pretty fantastic view and has so much space that if you're looking for an awesome space to rent for a venue I highly recommend contacting the owners of Backdrop!"
