I tried the S'more' Latte. I personally do not recommend.  There was not enough milk or something to taste like a latte.  My hubby enjoyed his drink, which was Toffee Latte.  We picked a cookie to share but it was dry.  We did sit outside which has a wonderful courtyard.\n\nIf you're in the area and visiting the shops there then I would recommend, but I would not go out of my way otherwise.  2 drinks and 1 cookie with a tip was $23 which was very fair on pricing.  Will just say service was great!!!!"

The baristas seemed to have a negative tone this morning.  I specifically inquired about the size of drink available in a cortado and cappucino.  Very simple order for most places.  I have enjoyed coffee all over the world and have never been given a 3oz cappucino or cortado (which to be honest belies a complete lack of understanding of how to construct these beverages).

I guess if you want a coffee shop that you can stand at the counter and have a 10 min conversation with the person behind the bar, then try another spot. I was in recently when either the owner or manager had stepped in to help the staff take orders and make drinks. He thanked every person who ordered."

When I asked your barista about the drink she respond stating the cup was not filled because of the ice. You and your employees should inform customers of the cups they are getting are not same when requesting no ice, hot and cold are different. I did not have a foul mouth. Your barista could not explain why but you did in your post. Another issue one of your barista insisted my daughter use her pin when paying for her drinks. I've never had to use it at your store."

            "review_text": "Hours are misleading! Wanted somewhere to study for a quick couple hours and saw that they were open until 8. I ordered my drink in a mug that I brought- a capuccino with chocolate- or you could call it a mocha with dry milk, I suppose. The barista made it for me, and literally 5 seconds after I sat down, they informed me, as well as the other customers, that they were \"closing their indoor seating\" in 5 minutes at 6:00. There goes my evening. At least they could have told me they were closing before I ordered my drink. I ordered it in a regular mug, not a travel one or anything, which I would think is a pretty clear sign I intend to stay.\nIt doesn't even say anywhere on their website or Instagram that their indoor seating closes early. At least make it evident if you're going to do that. I wasted an hour of my evening and 6$ because of misleading hours.\nAnd I wouldn't have said anything, but while we're at it, the drink was pretty mediocre. Could barely taste the espresso. I volunteered to pay for a large despite my mug being probably between 10 and 12 ounces. Just tasted like cocoa and too much, too dry milk- and I'm a barista, so I know what a good mocha or cappuccino tastes like. Also, there was no latte art, which definitely isn't expected, but it's another missed opportunity to make my experience more enjoyable. I only bought it because I wanted to hang out, which I was unable to do. I'll just say it didn't make up for the rest of my experience.\n\nJust disappointing. The barista was pleasant, but failed to provide me with the most basic and extremely relevant information. If you're going to have some kind of different indoor seating hours, at least advertise it well- unless the baristas are lying to make people leave early, which is, you know, worse. The customer shouldn't have to go out of their way to discover your secret hours. Probably will never go back."

It is my go-to coffee place, and I'm very fortunate (as a resident in Waverly) to have a beautiful hole-in-the-wall coffee shop to spend quality time in.  If you haven't been here, try any of their frozen drinks!!  So good... My staples are also the iced lavender latte (with oat milk), and the blackberry coffee lemonade during the summer.

They had a great selection of coffees, the vibe of the shop was awesome, there was good seating, and it was clean and well kept. The reason I can't give a full five stars is because the baristas were extremely rude. They looked thoroughly displeased to be serving us and everyone else who walked in, and were VERY short and dismissive in their interactions; not just with us but with everyone who came in after us, too. Their demeanor only changed when someone they knew came in; otherwise they honestly just seemed annoyed that any of us were there. The other minor issue we had was that the WiFi was extremely slow and kept cutting out, which made working there pretty difficult."

So I've never tried anything else, but I genuinely plan to. Eventually. \n\nThere's a Sta***cks in the same shopping centre, and if you're still going there after Moka opened, you're crazy...\nFor basically the same pricing, you could be getting actually delicious coffee from people who know how to brew coffee. Instead you waste your money and treat time on the fact that Sta***cks has a drive-thru?!\nI understand, sometimes you're on the way to work. But so are the 10 other people in line at that drive-thru every morning...\nIt's really not that difficult to park in one of the abundant spaces at Waverly near Moka, and get out of your car for the amount of time you'd have waited in the drive-thru line, if you're gonna get coffee.\n\nAnd when you're not in a rush? There's no excuse for sub-par coffee.\nI used to go to Sta***cks before Moka opened, but then, there were no good, independent coffee shops around locally with superior product.\n\nNow there is."

I can certainly see this as a place to come for a coffee beverage after having dinner in one of the many restaurants close by. The employee I interacted with while placing my order was friendly, although perhaps a little uninformed about what was sold. (When I was told that there were two coffee bean choices available, I asked if they were different roasts and was told that they were both \"brown\".) However, I feel like the kinks with service will be worked out. Beverage prices are comparable to national chains, but retail item prices are pretty high."
