The drink menu is vast and well developed and we have ordered \"off menu\" to great success. There is a \"favorites\" menu from baristas and locals that has some unique and wonderful drinks on it. The pastries and quick bites are very good. Try an affogato on a hot summer afternoon or a gingerbread latte in the winter, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe baristas are welcoming, professional, and highly skilled. The owners take incredible care of the shop, keep the menu fresh and exciting, and have always delivered a great experience. We love the feeling of community when we come in to visit.\n\nI used to take advantage of the free (and fast!) Wi-Fi to complete my coursework and study for exams. I never had trouble finding a table and an outlet to myself or to share with someone else doing computer work. The noise level is what you would expect for a community coffee house. It has plenty of comfortable seating to relax and hang out in. Board games are available upon request, and there are plenty of books and toys for the younger ones.\n\nDespite the construction woes, P&P has stayed a beacon of the community and is a powerful voice in the push to shop (and drink great coffee!) small."

You can have your own little area  to hang out or work because the way the couches and tables are sectioned out is brilliant. They also donated coffee and stickers to a community raffle for a nonprofit I'm part of which was really nice. They also have an adorable little childrens area with books, games, and a kids coffee cart!"

While she was giving her order, another man and woman came in and got in line behind me. Apparently, the people in front of me where meeting up with the people behind me. The lady in front of me invited them to get in front of me and, at first, they refused. The lady continued to give her order and again invited the couple behind me to get in front of me, which at this point, they did. The lady that invited them to get in front of me turned and said to me \"They're with me: Sorry\". The cashier paused and looked at them and me and then took the order of the two people that had gotten in front of me. I normally have a great experience at this coffee shop (and would probably still recommend them) But this experience left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThe cashier taking the two other people's order before mine caused a long wait for me: which is in the control of the shop. I would have just said something while I was there but I've been struggling with aphasia and talking in public can be embarrassing sometimes. So going to places where I can type out my order and show it makes things easier. But trying to type out why I don't think someone else should be allowed to get in front of me, shouldn't be necessary."

WOW 3 VETERANS WHO SEVERED THIS COUNTRY TOLD WE ARE BANDED FROM THERE CAUSE WE BOUGHT COFFEE AND WHERE CHARGING UP OUR STUFF LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THERE WAS.  These people are nothing but a joke and the fact that we spent $9 for 3 small coffees was the the worst part before that. Unless you have lots of money to spend don't go here it's not worth it."

I cannot express how lovely not only the atmosphere and coffee is but also the staff! These wonderful humans are always so positive and happy to create whatever concoction of morning life juice you are feeling!\n\nJust an example of how awesome they are:\n\nThis morning I went to get an iced carmel machiatto and after I took a few sips...I quickly realized this drink was a little too sweet for me... Not wanting to make a scene but equally thirsting for a morning treat...I politely asked if they would be willing to remake the drink for me with a few less pumps of sweetener... Instantly, joyfully, and sincerely one of the ladies gladly insisted on doing so and said \"We would rather you be happy !\"\n\nAHHH!!!!! GOOD VIBES...go here asap and support this amazing local business! <3 :)"

I'm so happy that this opened up so close to home. The owners and baristas are all really kind and the coffee seems to be consistent in taste no matter who makes it. Doesn't matter how many times I go here, I'm always blown away by the taste. It's not overpriced, which is definitely a plus. I'm hoping that there might be more syrup flavors added at some point, but it doesn't detract from the experience. I think my favorite part about this place- and I have many favorite parts- is their specials. I like trying drinks I've never thought I'd like, only to be surprised by how good it is. They had this amazing sweet potato drink in the fall which really stood out to me. I don't even like sweet potato, and it seemed so weird to have in coffee, but I ordered it every time I visited while they had it. It's just a great place. I'm so happy we have this gem."
