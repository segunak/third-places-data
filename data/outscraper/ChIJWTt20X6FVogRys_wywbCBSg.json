They made sure my order was just right, and the attention to detail truly showed in every sip. The coffee is exceptional, and I can tell that they take pride in using high-quality beans.\nWhat sets this place apart is the cozy ambiance. It's the perfect spot to unwind, whether you're catching up with friends or enjoying some quiet time with a good book. The attention to decor and the comfortable seating make it a hidden gem in Fort Mill.\nI highly recommend Humble Cup Coffee to anyone in the area.

The staff is incredibly friendly and always makes me feel welcome. They really know their coffee, and they're always happy to chat about different brewing methods or recommend a drink to suit your taste. I've tried a few of their lattes, and they're all amazing. The Matcha and homemade syrups are my favorite! They also have a great selection of pastries and other snacks, which are all fresh and delicious. I highly recommend Humble Cup Coffee Co. to anyone looking for a great cup of coffee in Fort Mill."

After grabbing my order, I saw they had a variety of local businesses items for sale. I ended up also buying some Honest Elderberry Co's Elderberry Honey and a cool black 14 Oz coffee mug for my husband.\nIt's a really modest but comfortable atmosphere inside (suits the name ) and my drink is perfect. The cookies are for my kids but I'm sure they'll be devoured because they look and smell awesome.\nThe woman and man working were both friendly and nice. When I mentioned it was my first time there, they explained where and when their pastries are delivered and what sorts to expect. I always love when small business supports other local, small businesses. Makes my cold dead heart beat a bit  lol\nDefinitely was surprised but happy to see on my way out, they have a small but nice little play room for kiddos. I'll have to bring my two with me the next time I come for a Chai and cookies. "

I wish they had different espresso types as the espresso they carry tasted bitter when I added a second shot to my chai, even after trying to \"fix\" it with some cane syrup.\nHave gone twice so far and the cheese danish they had the first time was delicious!

It is more 'kid' focused than other coffee shops and has a play area, which I'm sure is good for parents but not as good for the 'work from coffee shop' type of crowd. The parking is always full which can be a hassle but that's what happens when you're the only coffee in a 3 mile radius. The owners and baristas are always super nice and I love their coffee selection as well as their GIGANTIC pastries."

My only complaint is that the whole place reeks of bleach. I noticed this as soon as I sat down, and then a few mins later an employee came out with a bottle of lysol gingerly spraying every square inch. Bleach is very toxic and many people are very sensitive to it. It's also not a great smell as you are sipping on coffee. Y'all could honestly just mix vinegar and water in a spray bottle. If that is too old school, there are companies that make much less harsh of cleaners. At the very least if you must use bleach, use it once at the end of the day. Clean does not equal sanitized. You can just wipe down with a rag throughout the day and sanitize once. Sorry for the rant but when the smell of cleaner is stronger than the smell of coffee roasting- its too much."

He even had a grooms choice and brides choice sign to show off our favorite coffee drinks. Everyone loved the unique touch that it added to our day.
