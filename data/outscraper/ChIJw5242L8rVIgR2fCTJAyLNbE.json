            "review_text": "Whenever me and my friends want to get away from commercial coffee place like Dunking and Starbucks, we come to Crossroads. It has the best atmosphere for early morning chats or working during the midafternoon. I love the decorations and wooded interior of this coffee shop. Crossroads captures the local experience in Waxhaw perfectly. It is refreshing to sit down, sip on a cup of coffee and enjoy the old town vibes. The coffee here is not overpriced for the quality of coffee you are getting. The coffee is a bit strong for my taste, and that is why I don't come often but for this exact reason the coffee shop attracts a lot of customers. Many like the authentic taste of coffee that is lost within chain companies. When you want to get away from working at home this shop is a great place to do work. Every time I come here there are people working on their computers, partaking in business calls and sitting in on meetings. Whether you live in the town of Waxhaw or you are just visiting the Crossroads Coffee House is a local gem that is the best way to start your morning in this town."

I'll go in on a Monday and order a mocha frost that's nice and sweet, then I'll go in on a Saturday and it'll taste bland and much less flavorful. overall I love this place, but the inconsistencies need to be addressed."

Also, when I would ask a question the answer I got from her was \"I don't know I haven't been here in four years.\" You don't answer a customer that way. If you don't know some thing you should say, \"I'm not sure about that as I haven't been here in 4 years, but let me find out for you.\"\nAs her friend said, \"there are other coffee shops around\" and she's right. Next time I'm in town I'll go elsewhere!"
