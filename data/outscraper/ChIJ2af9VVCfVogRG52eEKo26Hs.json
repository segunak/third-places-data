            "review_text": "Nestled on the bustling 6259 South Boulevard in Charlotte, NC, SUMAQ Coffee & Catering is a hidden gem that delights the senses from the moment you step through its doors. This review can't fully capture the enchanting experience, but I'll do my best to convey the magic that awaits you at this incredible venue. With an exquisite blend of artisanal coffee, delightful pastries, and exceptional service, SUMAQ stands out as a beacon of culinary artistry and warm hospitality.\n\nAtmosphere & Design: A Contemporary Sanctuary\n\nSUMAQ's exterior is unassuming yet modern, welcoming visitors into a space that feels both contemporary and cozy. The moment you walk in, you're greeted by a minimalist yet chic interior, with a tasteful combination of wooden furnishings, industrial accents, and soft lighting that creates a serene and inviting atmosphere. The outdoor patio is an oasis in itself, perfect for a sunny day or a tranquil evening under the stars. The design seamlessly blends comfort with style, making it an ideal spot for everything from a quiet morning coffee to a leisurely afternoon catch-up with friends.\n\nCulinary Delights: A Feast for the Senses\n\nThe menu at SUMAQ is a curated selection of culinary delights that showcase a fusion of traditional and innovative flavors. The first thing that caught my eye was the signature iced matcha latte, beautifully layered in a mason jar. The vibrant green matcha contrasted elegantly with the creamy milk, creating a visual treat that was only surpassed by its taste. The matcha was of the highest quality, offering a rich, umami flavor balanced perfectly by the sweetness of the milk. It was a harmonious blend that was both refreshing and indulgent.\n\nNot to be outdone, the iced coffee was equally impressive. Served in a similar mason jar, the coffee had a deep, robust flavor with subtle notes of chocolate and caramel. It was the perfect companion to the delicious pastries I tried next. The flan was a masterpiece, with a silky, smooth texture that melted in your mouth. Topped with a single, vibrant raspberry, it was not just a dessert but a work of art. The caramel sauce was just the right amount of sweet, providing a delightful contrast to the creamy custard.\n\nThe alfajor, a traditional South American delight, was another highlight. This delicate pastry, filled with luscious dulce de leche and dusted with powdered sugar, was a bite-sized piece of heaven. It offered a perfect balance of sweetness and texture, with the buttery, crumbly cookie surrounding a rich, caramel-like filling. It's a treat that evokes the warm, comforting flavors of Latin America, making you feel right at home.\n\nService: A Touch of Excellence\n\nThe service at SUMAQ is in a league of its own, largely thanks to the charismatic and attentive Juan Pablo. His passion for the cafe and its offerings is evident in every interaction. Juan Pablo's knowledge of the menu and his genuine enthusiasm make every visit special. He has an uncanny ability to make you feel like the most important guest in the room, offering personalized recommendations and ensuring that every aspect of your experience is perfect. It's rare to find such a combination of professionalism and warmth, and it's clear that Juan Pablo and the entire team at SUMAQ take great pride in their work.\n\nA Perfect Conclusion\n\nSUMAQ Coffee & Catering is more than just a cafe; it's a destination that promises an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a local looking for your new favorite spot or a visitor exploring the culinary scene of Charlotte, SUMAQ offers something truly special. The thoughtful design, exceptional food and beverages, and unparalleled service come together to create an experience that's both sophisticated and heartfelt. I left SUMAQ not only satisfied but inspired, eagerly anticipating my next visit. Thank you, Juan Pablo, and the wonderful team at SUMAQ, for crafting such a memorable experience. This is a five-star gem that deserves every bit of its acclaim!"

My wife is Spanish and I am Italian and we both grew up drinking good coffee.   The coffee at Sumaq is excellent.  It has a smooth taste, isn't acidic, never over roasted or burnt, they understand how temperature impacts a coffees taste and it the lattes are sweetened but not overwhelmingly sweet.  We recommend their Sumaq latte.  I was very impressed that the owner remembers us and what we drink and genuinely takes an interest.   If this says anything, we drive 40 minutes just to come to this coffee shop!  Highly recommend.   :))"

It was just right. I didn't get any desserts this time around because I got a sandwich and the ham and cheese bread which was enough filling as it was. Both items were really good and the bread was fantastic. The atmosphere was nice and cozy and welcoming in not dark and dreary. The bathrooms were clean and bright! I wish there were more locations!"

The decor and seating was nice enough but I was very disappointed (after hyping them up based on reviews I'd read to my daughters).  We were not there long enough to be greeted by anyone which was not an issue.  The REAL problem was that there were gnats swarming around the food (lots of them) and noone seemed to be concerned to attempt to cover the food.  Also, I was disappointed to see that the food displayed did not look appealing.  I was VERY disappointed that the carrot cake they are charging $7 plus for looked like a \"carrot cake\" made in a sheet pant and cut into smaller squares.  They were not layered as advertised on their photos online.  They were literally squares cut from a larger sheet cake.  I am a baker, so I know quality baked goods when I see them and the carrot cake was not it.  There were other baked items where the gnats were that looked burned on the top.  It was very disappointing to see this, as I was so excited about our first (and last trip) to this shop.\n\nIn fairness, we were not there long enough to be greeted and the location was very crowded, so sitting was not an option as well. The furniture looked attractive enough in appearance but that was it for the atmosphere. The online photos and videos are much more appealing than what we saw.\n\nI hope this review will ignite some change in this business's standards, as our first visit was very disappointing as compared to the expectations.  Good luck to them, I know running a business is not an easy task but there are some changes needed.\n\nGodspeed Sumaq!"

The chai was phenomenal, and I loved the artwork that went into it. Not every coffee shop I go to serves their chai this way so it is always a pleasant surprise when I receive it like this! The ham and cheese reminded me more of a doughy stromboli versus an empanada but I still enjoyed it. This may have just been a miscommunication though since I don't think they meant to say this was an empanada. However, I would love to try their empanadas sometime! Unfortunately, they were just out of them when I had visited. Lastly, that alfajores which was a divine little cookie. The shortbread cookie was perfect and the dulce de leche filling was tasty. They have indoor and outdoor seating and additional parking in the back. It was also getting quite busy after I sat down so it seems to be a popular spot in the area too."

Lots of great options for fuller meals, like freshly made sandwiches, wraps, waffles etc. As well as an assortment of delicious pastries.\n\nI got one of the sandwiches and their seasonal pumpkin latte. The latte took about 5 mins to prepare and the food about 15. Both were delicious, the only mention I'd have in regard to being un-positive is that the pumpkin coffee didn't really taste like pumpkin, just more like a seasonal spiced latte. But it was still delicious.\n\nReally recommend this spot, they also have outlets and Wi-Fi it's a great coffee spot to get some work done in if you want to be out :)"

You can come for breakfast to have a pastry or empanada with your coffee. For lunch or dinner, I strongly suggest the Wasi House sandwich. It is shredded chicken, bacon, caramelized pineapples, cheese and pepper sauce. If the person preparing it toasts the middle of the sandwich at the cut, the crispness adds another layer of texture and flavor. This time someone did not do it, but the sandwich is still one of the only ones I fawn over in Charlotte.\n\nNow that Sumaq latte is a whole vibe. You can get a cinnamon latte almost anywhere, but I promise you that this one tastes like REAL cinnamon and not a flavored syrupy mess. It is the perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and bitter. I was suggested this the first time I came and can't move myself to try anything else. If they have chica morada, Peruvian purple corn drink, do order it. I like to order it with no ice to take home where I add tequila or dark rum. It is perfectly fine as is, but this cocktail takes greatness to perfection for me.\n\nThe interior? See the video I posted. The outdoor area transports you to Peru though you are perched directly on South Blvd. If you can tune out the traffic, you can enter bliss.\n\nBig thumbs up to the stools that a disabled plus size vertically challenged woman to sit with ease. This is a rarity at establishments."

It has great ambience with relaxing and well decorated design perfectly for everyone who need space for social activities and focus time.\n\nAs I can't process heavily sugared dessert, empanada was recommended to me. I chose chicken and olive for the filling and it has turned out so delicious! The dip is divine as I could taste a hint of masala and it goes well amazingly with the empanada! Truly a must go cafe in Charlotte area."

The woman that took my order was super sweet and the men were really nice as well. The mocha latte was good and I'm happy I tried the guava and cheese roll. Definitely something different to try in the morning, but filling! I liked the beef empanada. I assumed it would just be beef and not beef and potatoes. I think it would have been better that way. However, I LOVED the dipping sauce!! When I got it, it had a small kick, perfect flavor for the beef. I really could have dumped the entire sauce inside my empanada. All in all, a solid spot to try!"

We walked up to the couter and saw the menu and it was nicely done and the pastries were right up my alley. The employee (who didn't greet us as we walked in) was making orders in fairness, Never looked up or even acknowledged that we were standing there. We stood there for I know was 3 minutes. If you don't think that's a long time. Sit still without looking at your phone or speaking for 3 minutes. We looked at one another and decided to drive down to Pineville to Amalies where they were 4x as busy and we were greeted as we walked in and when we got to the counter. I'm not one that says \"I'll never come here again\" everyone has a bad day. However you only get 2 shots at my wallet. Hopefully it's better the next time. I love supporting local businesses."

The coffee is excellent, the staff is very friendly and helpful and they have both sweet and savory food, including the best damn empanadas colombianas I've had. The atmosphere is clean and bright with a touch of \"reclaimed industrial space\" and plenty of seating as well as a beautiful outdoor patio. The only negative is that the location is a little bit difficult to get to and parking is extremely limited, but those are more of a \"Charlotte can't city plan its way out of a wet paper bag\" problem. If you can get past that and make it in, you won't be disappointed."

The interior design is so organic, welcoming, and minimalistic with a TON of natural light.\nThe coffee is very smooth and well-served.\n\nElmer, our barista, was very kind and attentive and was manning the bar by himself, hence expect a slower service.\n\nBe aware that for near $10, the sandwiches are only enough for a small bite, so don't come super hungry.\n\nSumaq is great to camp out and do some computer work or for a cute coffee date."
