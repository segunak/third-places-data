All the food is extremely bland and with the $16 price tag my food came with I expected a lot more. How they managed to get a second location is a mystery, tons of better eats in Charlotte. My advice would be to actually focus on the food instead of an Instagram worthy dining room."

She got a sprite that was $3.50 and a tiny iced cookie that was mediocre at best for $5.00.   We ended up throwing the meals in the trash. Definitely not going to return. Not good."

Great food, location, staff was friendly, very clean here and the decor was very nice inside. This was a former Hubee Dee's chicken restaurant and they turned it very nice inside here.\n\nThis salted melon is different from the Southend location so there's not a market inside like you would see at Southend, but you have Harris Teeter right down the road so it's not a big deal for a market here.\n\nThe food was amazing along with the iced lattes we got! We definitely enjoyed this location a lot and will return back for sure.\n\nAs an FYI, parking does get super busy here so be aware of that when you come at prime time lunch or breakfast time. Make sure you also download their app so you can earn reward points! It definitely will help you in the long run!"
