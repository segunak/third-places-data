The venue's expansive windows offered breathtaking views, creating a truly stunning atmosphere as the evening unfolded. The versatile seating options both inside and outside the shop were perfect for accommodating my large group of 50 guests. The space provided an ideal setup for a DJ, a designated area for dancing, a Photo Booth, and even room for catered BBQ meal, complete with a selection of wine and beer at counter.\n\nThe service provided by Summit Coffee was exceptional, and the owners went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. Their accommodating nature and abundance of fantastic ideas added an extra layer of magic to the event. If you are in search of the perfect venue for your next gathering, I wholeheartedly recommend considering Summit Coffee- it exceeded all of my expectations."

Street parking is sometimes available (pay attention to towing zone signs), but the parking situation was frustrating at best and definitely put a damper on my experience.\nOnce I found a place to park, I walked in to the calming, familiar teal interior of the cafe. Baristas were... not my favorite. They weren't explicitly rude, but very cold and seemed annoyed at me questioning the menu. Asked if any sweets were dairy free, barista just shrugged. That's okay--they weren't marked, I didn't expect barista to know but a verbal response would have been appreciated.\nHowever, the biggest reason for the three stars is that NONE of the cold foam drinks can be made dairy-free. In 2023, it is ridiculous that they REFUSE to do this, even Sbux can do it for some drinks! I didn't even bother asking them to use sanitized equipment for my drink after hearing this. I got the (seasonal, I think) lavender honey latte, but did not enjoy the charge for DF milk, as other Summit locations don't have this.\nAll in all, the Plaza location is only 10 minutes away and far better than this one."
