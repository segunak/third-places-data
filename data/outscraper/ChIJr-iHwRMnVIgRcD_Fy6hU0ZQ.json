I said that was fine and I would still take my items but explained to her that they had obviously been marking the records wrong because a lot of the records had stickers despite her saying they were not on sale. I understand that she could have been frustrated with people moving stickers on items but it was clear that a big part of the issue was that they were not marking their items accurately seeing as she said my items were not included in the sale yet many of the records had stickers and when I tried to inform her of this she was beyond rude. I know customer service is frustrating but she had no reason to speak to anyone the way that she spoke to me today. My sister had to step outside because she was getting so upset with how this woman was speaking. (Also if the sticker system does not work and leads to inaccuracy there are many other ways to do sales and clearly this store needs to find another way)"

I told him no thanks at first but after a while of failing to find anything that piqued my interest, I searched for him again and asked for his opinions. He proceeded to give a good 10 minute in depth talk about horror books he loves and what he thinks might appeal to me; I grabbed a particularly interesting sounding book he recommended  and he was kind enough to reduce it 50% as a Christmas gift. It was nice to see someone talk so passionately, especially when it's something related to their field of work. Days later and I cannot put these books down (Drew knows his stuff)"

Today I went up there early Gabby was amazingly helpful. She found these 5 books for me and helped me look for some special children's books. She was patient, kind and respectful. Then it ended up she checked me out as well. So not only is her customer service impeccable she is clearly a go getter and great at multi tasking. Both if these young people deserve a raise and Gabby should be in management training if she isn't already."

The lady was an older white lady. She was so scared she didn't tell me right away until now, even though the whole ordeal was extremly strange and rude in the moment. The next cashier came and took our purchase. Her face visably changed. She seemed uncomfortable. Now i think she may have heard what her coworker said. I am extremely appalled and angry . Will be going again to identify if this lady is still there and make a formal complaint. I am disgusted. My sister is extremely shy and never goes up to pay for herself and the first time she does, this happens l. I have been going for years and this has never happened. I know there is good people who work there but I hope the coworker reported her for gross inappropriate behavior and to a child no less."
