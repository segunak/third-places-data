They quickly ran to lock the drive thru doors and just kind of looked at me and laughed and ran away! As a loyal Starbucks costumer I am so disappointed with the costumer service. I can understand wanting to clean up but one hot coffee wouldn't have hurt ? And to act as if I'm completely not standing there while they still had people sitting outside was insane . We then called at 8:45 the store to ask \"hey you see me standing here why are you closed 20 minutes early and laughing about it ?\" But they didn't even pick up. What's worse is this is my local Starbucks and a new one and now I don't even want to ever go there again!!"

If she don't like her job she should just quit. Not make someone else's experience miserable because she's having a bad day.

This is not a drive thru that you can leave once you've gone in-unless there aren't cars behind you (the driveway is bordered with bricks on both sides). When we finally got to the window the barista didn't apologize and when we suggested that in the future, if they get a patrons drink order wrong, they should tell them to drive up and then bring them the correct order when it's ready instead of keeping 6 cars in the drive thru line captive, he responded with \"we don't have a protocol for that...\". Whether you have a \"protocol\" or not, keeping 6 cars stuck in line for 15 mins should not be your default. It's extremely inconvenient and not mindful of your customers time. Disappointing."
