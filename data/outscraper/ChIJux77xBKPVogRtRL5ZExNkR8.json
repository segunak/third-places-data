The temperature is fantastic, and the flavor is amazing.\n\nThis is the ambrosia of the gods!\n\nOh, and flavor wise, the coffee isn't sour and tastes like actual coffee, not burnt like Dunkin or Starbucks! It's local and independently owned.\n\nOh, and atmosphere! Calm music, great little tables, and chairs i could spend hours here just working.\n\nDon't even worry about parking. You have a whole parking lot to choose from.\n\nNow there are cons... I want more couches to lounge in while I read... I know picky picky me, but hey, I can always ask.\n\nLove this place! (^_^)/\""
