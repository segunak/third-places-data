She said that she'd add more syrup however Starbucks had changed their recipes to two pumps and if I wanted more syrup it would be extra next time I order this drink. I thanked her and left. I ordered the same drink from a different location in the next few days and was assured by that store that the drink indeed still gets four pumps of vanilla syrup!\nIt made me furious that a Starbucks employee would lie to you when being called out for making your beverage wrong! Not the first time I'm having issues with this particular location. I made a special trip and spoke with a manger on duty, she offered me a free beverage which I declined. I'm not sure you can put a price tag on a lie from your employee!? This location has lost my trust and business indefinitely."

It also has a nice outdoor courtyard area to sit and sip when the weather is nice.\n\nMy favorite drinks: cinnamon dolce latte (hot), white chocolate mocha (hot), and the white chocolate mocha frappe. \n\nThe seasonal drinks are also fun, like the pumpkin spice latte, but I usually don't buy them right when they are released. I like to wait until closer to the season/colder weather (for example) because it feels more festive. And I don't get tired of the drink by the time fall gets here.\n\nFavorite food items: chocolate croissant, bacon egg and cheese croissant, spinach and egg white wrap with the guacamole dip (sold separately)."

They are so welcoming and always go above and beyond.\nToday I am most grateful, because I ordered thru door dash because my morning was cut short-  and inside of the bag was my order, along with the little request I ask of them everytime I go in to get my drink. That made my morning. Truly the best team  10/10"

Neither one proceeded to wash their hands after touching the phone. They both touched their hair, then face then one even twisted her nose ring right in front of me again no hand washing. She proceeded to help the other young lady out the lid on my cup touching the rim as well as the lid. I'm in the food industry and this is unacceptable. Management needs to do a better job with training. Phones, noses, hair and face etc carry germs and bacteria."

I ordered ahead on the app at 6:56 am, which said 3-6 min pickup time, and did not receive my order (iced coffee and chocolate croissant) until 7:12am almost 20 min later. Meanwhile several people walked in, ordered at the counter, and received their order before I got mine. I asked several people about my order, and all they could say was \"it's coming\". No apologies, no thanks for my patience, just \"its coming\". Avoid this location at all costs if you are in any kind of hurry."

I was wondering if I did something wrong. I did tell them I don't intend to eat inside the store and I am leaving. They all stood right there till I was out of the store. I showed them food particles were all over the table. It was clear that a group of people did come before my visit and had spent time. But it was so invisible for them. Weird !!\n\n2. It's been 2 years I have been requesting them not to use ice in my drinks . But I guess this too is non considerable. As per the manager no drink can be made without ice. . I mean really ?\n\n3. I prefer less sweet and that too honey. But these guys are extreme . Either they will make your drink too sweet or no sweet at all.\n\nOverall. Poor staff and poor drinks."

Well.. having to meet a friend at this local, the last straw was the kid who kept messing up drinks because he was chatting more than paying attention to what people ordered.  Line of customers waiting for drinks got longer and 12 minutes later I asked him to bring my drink when he was done talking.  Questioning if I actually purchased a drink, he then proceeded to shout across the room to ask my name and then say he didn't get a label.  Yeah right.  He apologized but then yelled again asking what I got.  Needless to say I told him to figure it out- I already told him and so did his coworker.\n20 minutes later... from the time I ordered, I was brought my drink from a nice and responsible older gentleman apologizing for the poor customer service I received.\nFriend was delayed and I called to meet her at Blakeney local instead."

I do not like the mocha latte. I don't like it because I don't like coffee. Overall I give it a 5 out of 5 because I love the people and the atmosphere."
