Their coffees and matchas are one of the best i've tried so far in Charlotte and their prices are budget friendly! I recommend 100/10."

She was even so kind as to lend me a charger that I was missing for my MacBook during my time there (of nearly two hours).

I eventually plan to own a coffee shop of my own and the vibe emulated exactly what I would look for out of my own business. The set up was also perfect for the size of their space with plenty of space to walk. They're also connected to a shop by a hallway on the left if you want to walk around afterwards!\n\nIf you're someone who wants many options, this would be a place you go to get out of your comfort zone! Their menu only consisted of two seasonal drinks and your typical standards like lattes, cappuccinos, etc.\n\nWe had the evergreen latte which is made with Juniper, Rosemary, Molasses and oat milk. The perfect drink to try for those that need something lactose free and still want a bit of sweetness to their coffee!"

There is a bistro set to sit outside during warmer months, but the cozy grandparents 60's/70s basement vibe inside is nostalgically inviting and cozy. Not a lot of seating but worth it."

Limitations are the destroyer.\" This is exactly the same sentiment that Provided Kitchen stands by.\n\nOn my first visit there, i was expecting hipster-trash-heap, but instead was pleasantly surprised with upscale-professional-casual-stylish-trash-heap. Very chique. The open ceiling, water attractions, and smoking area make it a great spot to bring the kiddos. I heard from the CEO of Provided Provisions (we are close now) that they might be installing a TV solely dedicated to Wii Sports. I honestly don't know why other coffee shops in the area are not doing this? The coffee is the best bean juice that you can get from a can, times 100. It's not anything like the watery stuff from a can of garbanzos. Have you ever had fresh hummus? It's not like that either. It's different.\n\nProvided Industries has given me new reason the scream at the mirror in the morning (in a good way). I've only been once, but once is enough. I will definitely be back. 4 stars."

            "review_text": "Nestled in an unassuming shell of a building on an unassuming corner in the north eastern corridor of uptown Charlotte exists an enfantile coffee project. Started by two childhood best friends, Provided Coffee is the newest, best kept secret in Charlotte. If you've never experienced a Provided Coffee Cart event then you've never experienced the best coffee that Charlotte has to offer from the kindest young men to ever do it. Their new storefront space is carefully adorned with thriving plant life and touches of authentic vintage memorabilia. An eclectic blend of mid century modern and late 80's art deco sensibilities, Cohen Malz and Preston Rollins (the 20 year old co-owners) have poured their experiences and preferences and musical tastes and vivid love for living into a space that's thrilling to the senses while comforting to the soul. A reinvigorating steroid shot into the whimsical sense of childlike wonder that lives in all of us. All in a coffee shop.\nAnd you'd better get there soon because the secret's gettin out."
