La Dolcekca came up & another place but I chose here after seeing people rave about the banana pudding but, I thought it was just ok. I got the biscoff banana pudding. It was good but not worth the drive I took to get there. I also got a tiramisu which was $10 for a small pan & it wasn't sweet at all. Tasted mostly like the coco on top. You can honestly get a bigger slice for less at Publix. I agree with others that say they are overpriced but their price is their price so I won't speak much on that. Overall,  wouldn't go back for the dessert but I didn't have a bad experience. Just a little overhyped per the reviews imo."

We ordered our food and an item we ordered was inco.mplete because they didn't have the ingredients. That would be fine but the Lady at the counter agued with us about a refund for an item that they don't have but is on their menu and took our money for when we ordered. The espresso was watery and tasted like cinnamon. They say that have dolce de leches but it is just black coffee with caramel syrup. Every time they asked how the food was and we told them the truth, they proceeded to argue with us about it. Also, I speak Spanish and they didn't know, each time they went back to the kitchen they would talk trash about us in Spanish. I would say skip this place. Also the empanadas were bland and the tables were dirty. Also over priced food"

The ham & cheese empanada was very good, the seasoning on the beef empanada had too much vinegar and rosemary. The passion fruit flan was good overall, however the tres leches cake was the worst I've ever had and that is simply not okay for a Dominican pastry shop. We tried several other items that were decent overall. Unfortunately, the server forgot to add the rice pudding for our take home order that we paid for, and so sadly we left disappointed with no plans on future repeat business. I guess that's just how it goes sometimes."

            "review_text": "La Dolcekca Bakery Cafe in Charlotte, NC, is a delightful culinary paradox nestled in The Montford Shops, a stone's throw from Angry Ales and Bowlero. It's the kind of place where the Caribbean meets Paris in a New York minute, and you can't help but feel you've stumbled upon a hidden gem.\n\nUpon entry, the sweet serenades of Frank Reyes set the stage for an experience that's as authentically Dominican as it gets, with a French twist. Karina, the owner's daughter and apparent queen of multitasking, greeted me with a smile that could light up the room. The display case was a kaleidoscope of treats - think tres leches in flavors you didn't know existed, flans that wobble just right, and cupcakes that make you question your loyalty to your diet.\n\nNow, let's talk about the menu. It's like the United Nations of pastries and sandwiches. I bravely ventured to try their Chimi, a sandwich that's a culinary hug from the Dominican Republic, squeezed onto what I suspect is French bread. It's a constellation of flavors with pulled pork, tomato, cheese, and a condiment symphony. But wait, there's more - it's pressed to perfection, accompanied by the kind of fries that remind you of childhood and a ramekin of ketchup that's probably just there to feel important.\n\nThe price might raise an eyebrow - $15.50 for the Chimi and $8 for the bread pudding - but remember, you're not just buying food; you're funding a culinary dream. However, I must admit, the Chimi was saltier than my last breakup. Next time, I'll stick to the pastries or give their chopped cheese a shot.\n\nAh, the caramel bread pudding - now that's the real MVP! It's like eating a cloud made of sugar, spice, and everything nice. Karina's reheating tip was spot on - it's a dessert that keeps on giving.\n\nA slight hiccup - the place was as barren of napkins as a desert, but a quick request later, and voila! Napkin oasis.\n\nAnd don't forget to join their rewards program - who doesn't like being rewarded for treating themselves? Plus, they do custom cakes, because why not add more sweetness to life?\n\nIn summary, La Dolcekca is where your taste buds go on a mini-vacation. It's a charming spot with heart, flavor, and a dash of Dominican flair. Worth every penny and every minute(20 min) of the wait!"

I ordered the fresh Mandarin Juice and Empanadas, 1 of each flavor (Ham & Cheese, Pulled Pork BBQ, Pepperoni Pizza, and Cheese). My friends ordered gourmet waffles with a side of eggs and the Salmon Chipotle sandwich with a side of fries. Everything was delicious. My friend got the Eggnog Tres Leches to go and I got the Strawberry Almond Cherry Cupcake for my MIL to go. I will definitely come back for more!"

Karina's (Owner) special touch on this sandwich is everything. They offer a wide array of desserts, and they are all fresh, tasty and moist. We got cupcakes, carrot cake, Tres Leches, and flan - all YUMMY!!!!\n#2 The owner and staff are AMAZING!!!!!

This is a cute little place and the decor is very nice and inviting. I ordered 2 cupcakes. The female employee was so wonderful and kind and tried her best to assist me. None of the cupcakes were labeled so I didn't know what I was ordering and had to rely on the employee to tell me what the flavors were and she didn't seem to know all of the flavors either since all you can see is the frosting. The actual cake portion of the cupcake is covered up by the cardboard wrapper.\nI ordered a strawberry cupcake and another that she said was \"chocolate\". The one that she gave me was not chocolate, it was actually some type of spice cake. It was pretty good even though it wasn't what I wanted. The strawberry cake on the other hand was awful. It was hard as a rock and tasted like it may have been sitting in the display  case for days. For over $5 for each cupcake, I was pretty disappointed. I see that all of their positive reviews are about the food so I think I will just try the food next time."

Instead of taking responsibility, the owner kept blaming him and caused a back-and-forth argument when she should have added it to her calendar. As a result to their forgetfulness, they rushed to make the cake, resulting in a final design that bore no resemblance to what he had initially shown them. To top it off, the cake filling they used was not the one he had requested.\n\nThe white hearted shaped cake is was was requested and the pink not even heart shaped was what the gave."
