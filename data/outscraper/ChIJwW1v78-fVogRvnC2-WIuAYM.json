We bought banana pudding cheesecake (my personal favorite), keylime pie (filling was bursting with delicious keylime flavor, but the crust was wet & I'm not use to a wet crust).  Also tried the brookie (brownie with a vanilla cookie dough mixed in) & it was yummy .  Lastly, we also tried the carrot cake.  While the cakes flavor was good, I was not a fan of the whipped topping.  Normally, carrot cakes are topped with a cream cheese frosting, although the cake did have a thin cream cheese filling between each layer.  Overall, we enjoyed the treats & definitely recommend you give La Dolcekca Bakery Cafe a try!"

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere, amazing service, and even complimentary juice--a delightful touch!\n\nThe menu is incredible, offering a diverse selection of delicious pastries, cakes, cookies, and savory treats from around the world. My fiancee ordered a cold brew with cold foam, and I had a caramel frappe--the best frappe I've ever had! We also tried the chicken empanada (so good!) and the pepperoni pizza empanada, which instantly took my fiancee back to his childhood memories of Puerto Rican bakeries. The mayo-ketchup sauce was the perfect pairing! Unfortunately, the beef empanadas were sold out--but that just proves how popular they are!\n\nBeyond the baked goods, they even have Dubai chocolate and a gelato stand--a rare find! The owner also offers baking classes, which is such a unique and exciting opportunity for anyone who loves to bake.\n\nThe ambiance is stunning--warm pink tones, cozy seating, and a personal, welcoming feel. Whether you're here for coffee, a quick bite, or a sweet treat, this bakery is a must-visit in Charlotte.\n\n 10/10 Highly Recommend! This is officially our go-to spot for coffee, pastries, and delicious food in Charlotte whenever we're in town!"

We ended up staying because we paid $52 for two sandwiches and two coffees. It took 42 minutes for the food to arrive and 28 minutes for the coffees, while we watched them prepare for the day. The menu says bagel, but they did not have any, so it was just plain bread. The ingredients used to make the sandwiches were of the lowest quality, even their Walmart-quality fries. The worst part was honestly the cheese they used... oh, and I got a macchiato, which I'm pretty sure was just plain coffee. Maybe baking is their forte, which we didn't try."

Amazing drinks, rice pudding, cake, tea, cookies, and chocolate. There was a period where I insisted on going here just for bread pudding and a cup of passion fruit juice. The owner is also incredibly pleasant and always available to answer questions and provide service. We've sat in and taken out and every time has been very nice. The decorations are also my favorite, lots of flowers, color, and tons of colorful teapots and carafes that they apparently use for tea and coffee service during events.

My wife picked the cocosito and I chose the lemon bar. We split a coffee.\n\nThe coffee was excellent. The cocosito was dry. The lemon bar was very good with a strong lemon flavor and a creamy curd though the crust was too thick and it took out our plastic spoon.\n\nLots of options for baked goods and they also do sandwiches. The brewed to order coffee is excellent."

Wish they'd have mild and tell you it's hot.\nTheir other pastries are priced higher than other patisseries/bakeries.

La Dolcekca came up & another place but I chose here after seeing people rave about the banana pudding but, I thought it was just ok. I got the biscoff banana pudding. It was good but not worth the drive I took to get there. I also got a tiramisu which was $10 for a small pan & it wasn't sweet at all. Tasted mostly like the coco on top. You can honestly get a bigger slice for less at Publix. I agree with others that say they are overpriced but their price is their price so I won't speak much on that. Overall,  wouldn't go back for the dessert but I didn't have a bad experience. Just a little overhyped per the reviews imo."

We ordered our food and an item we ordered was inco.mplete because they didn't have the ingredients. That would be fine but the Lady at the counter agued with us about a refund for an item that they don't have but is on their menu and took our money for when we ordered. The espresso was watery and tasted like cinnamon. They say that have dolce de leches but it is just black coffee with caramel syrup. Every time they asked how the food was and we told them the truth, they proceeded to argue with us about it. Also, I speak Spanish and they didn't know, each time they went back to the kitchen they would talk trash about us in Spanish. I would say skip this place. Also the empanadas were bland and the tables were dirty. Also over priced food"

The ham & cheese empanada was very good, the seasoning on the beef empanada had too much vinegar and rosemary. The passion fruit flan was good overall, however the tres leches cake was the worst I've ever had and that is simply not okay for a Dominican pastry shop. We tried several other items that were decent overall. Unfortunately, the server forgot to add the rice pudding for our take home order that we paid for, and so sadly we left disappointed with no plans on future repeat business. I guess that's just how it goes sometimes."

She loved the atmosphere the customer service was lovely and when we asked her about the food 1-10 she gave it a 12.

            "review_text": "La Dolcekca Bakery Cafe in Charlotte, NC, is a delightful culinary paradox nestled in The Montford Shops, a stone's throw from Angry Ales and Bowlero. It's the kind of place where the Caribbean meets Paris in a New York minute, and you can't help but feel you've stumbled upon a hidden gem.\n\nUpon entry, the sweet serenades of Frank Reyes set the stage for an experience that's as authentically Dominican as it gets, with a French twist. Karina, the owner's daughter and apparent queen of multitasking, greeted me with a smile that could light up the room. The display case was a kaleidoscope of treats - think tres leches in flavors you didn't know existed, flans that wobble just right, and cupcakes that make you question your loyalty to your diet.\n\nNow, let's talk about the menu. It's like the United Nations of pastries and sandwiches. I bravely ventured to try their Chimi, a sandwich that's a culinary hug from the Dominican Republic, squeezed onto what I suspect is French bread. It's a constellation of flavors with pulled pork, tomato, cheese, and a condiment symphony. But wait, there's more - it's pressed to perfection, accompanied by the kind of fries that remind you of childhood and a ramekin of ketchup that's probably just there to feel important.\n\nThe price might raise an eyebrow - $15.50 for the Chimi and $8 for the bread pudding - but remember, you're not just buying food; you're funding a culinary dream. However, I must admit, the Chimi was saltier than my last breakup. Next time, I'll stick to the pastries or give their chopped cheese a shot.\n\nAh, the caramel bread pudding - now that's the real MVP! It's like eating a cloud made of sugar, spice, and everything nice. Karina's reheating tip was spot on - it's a dessert that keeps on giving.\n\nA slight hiccup - the place was as barren of napkins as a desert, but a quick request later, and voila! Napkin oasis.\n\nAnd don't forget to join their rewards program - who doesn't like being rewarded for treating themselves? Plus, they do custom cakes, because why not add more sweetness to life?\n\nIn summary, La Dolcekca is where your taste buds go on a mini-vacation. It's a charming spot with heart, flavor, and a dash of Dominican flair. Worth every penny and every minute(20 min) of the wait!"

This is a cute little place and the decor is very nice and inviting. I ordered 2 cupcakes. The female employee was so wonderful and kind and tried her best to assist me. None of the cupcakes were labeled so I didn't know what I was ordering and had to rely on the employee to tell me what the flavors were and she didn't seem to know all of the flavors either since all you can see is the frosting. The actual cake portion of the cupcake is covered up by the cardboard wrapper.\nI ordered a strawberry cupcake and another that she said was \"chocolate\". The one that she gave me was not chocolate, it was actually some type of spice cake. It was pretty good even though it wasn't what I wanted. The strawberry cake on the other hand was awful. It was hard as a rock and tasted like it may have been sitting in the display  case for days. For over $5 for each cupcake, I was pretty disappointed. I see that all of their positive reviews are about the food so I think I will just try the food next time."

He showed them a picture to confirm the design. However, when it was time to pick up the cake, they claimed it wasn't ready because they had forgotten about it. Instead of taking responsibility, the owner kept blaming him and caused a back-and-forth argument when she should have added it to her calendar. As a result to their forgetfulness, they rushed to make the cake, resulting in a final design that bore no resemblance to what he had initially shown them. To top it off, the cake filling they used was not the one he had requested.\n\nThe white hearted shaped cake is was was requested and the pink not even heart shaped was what the gave."

Nothing like NYC food buttttt this place is amazing. Very tasty. Reminds me of a spot in the South Bronx and the food is just about as close to NYC as you will get in the QC. Staff is amazing. Found my little piece of Heaven."
