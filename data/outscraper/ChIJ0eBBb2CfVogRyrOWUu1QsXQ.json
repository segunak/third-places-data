So I literally made a phone call to let them know to write the food name on the box label. When I arrived, it was ready and none of the label was written. I asked the guy to write it, and he was super mad and upset. Then he went and wrote it for me. I reached home and not a single side was included such as potato chips and other sides that was all selected. Not only that couple of items were missing as well. Fruit juice and ice tea was a separate order, which was not in the package. I will not recommend this for Doordash order. Included pics and videos of indoor and also the guy who was upset."

The bar is in the center, and the order and pick up window for savory foods is on the right. You can order food while sitting at the bar as well.\n\nI really enjoyed the openness of the space as well as all the natural light. The garage doors are probably fun to open in the spring and fall.

I eat plant based and went with a gluten free friend and another with no dietary restrictions, so we wanted to try to find somewhere we could all eat.\nI had the vegan breakfast burrito which was so good! One friend got a chicken caesar wrap (yay, gluten free wrap!) and the other got a reuben.\nWe also grabbed some lattes at the coffee counter which were awesome! I had an iced oat milk latte with vanilla and it was perfectly creamy, nutty, and sweet.\nThis seems like a really nice place to stop in for a bite, a coffee, a snack, or even a bottle of wine to take home. They also have a bar in the middle which seemed to have beer on draft. I also saw plenty of people there to work on laptops and collaborate with others (there is a conference room possibly able to be rented?) so it would be an awesome place to get work done, hang with friends, or grab something to go.\nThere is also parking for Elizabeth St. shops just across the street!"

I tend to avoid uptown because of parking, but this place was well worth it. I parked on the side street but later saw a parking lot across the street.\n\nI sat at the bar because it was the first thing I really noticed when I walked in. It was mildly busy that day. There were so many smiling faces, and the staff immediately assisted me when I stated it was my first time in.\n\nI ordered the vegan platter (yes, of course, I want the sausage with it) and a lavender vanilla latte with oat milk.\n\nLater, before leaving, I went to the bakery, which is located right inside and to the left and got the donut (vanilla birthday cake) and muffin (chocolate chip). The vegan and gluten-free were on the top shelf and clearly labeled in the case #win\n\nBack to the meal... I ordered and paid at the bar and was told to wait for the text that I would receive when my order was ready. I was directed to the back of the store for the food and the bakery for the coffee, but the bartender grabbed and delivered the items directly to me (so many thanks!)\n\nThe food automatically came in to go containers. I appreciated that because it made it easier for me to go from the bar to a table to work (no laptops were allowed at the bar 10a-2p.\n\nI completely enjoyed everything I ate! It was flavored and cooked to perfection \n\nTo say I'll be going back there is an understatement! You'll have to try this place! There are plenty of vegan options, and the price was VERY good for brunch!\n\nNot a full 5 stars because I asked for iced water, and the staff at the bakery counter told me to get the water from the community container. It's awesome that they offer this, but there was no ice.\nAlso, they had me pay on a device and left the device in front of me for most of my meal. It was awkward and made me feel like I was supposed to do something more."

The bowl was filling by itself. The grits were on point; the food was still hot when delivered. The fruit was fresh. The drinks were hot, too. The jasmine was good, but I could use another apple chai on a cold day like today. I'd only had regular chai up to that point and wanted to try something different. It was very good.\n\nThe good reviews helped me decide to try them that day. Hopefully this one will help you decide, too."

            "review_text": "My partner and I came here for lunch and ordered a regular pizza, but asked to make it vegan. The staff person who took our order was very kind and let us know that it would not be a problem which was perfect for me because I am lactose intolerant and have been vegan for 2 years. The pizza came out quickly and it was delicious. Unfortunately, we didn't realize it until we were done eating that the cook in the back put real parmesan cheese on top of the vegan cheese . We saw little white specks on the pizza as we were eating, but we also asked for the balsamic vinaigrette (which we know is vegan) and it has little specks in it so we thought it was that. However, after we completely devoured the pizza we saw dry white specks in the box that were definitely parmesan. I brought it up to John, one of the workers, and he was very responsive, apologetic, and offered to refund us for the pizza. I was okay with that and not super upset because I thought it was just a light sprinkle of cheese but shortly after we left People's Market at 6pm, I got the worst nausea, and I stayed up until 3am with terribleee stomach pain and a lot of mucus buildup. I have never felt that much stomach pain in my life. Apparently, there was way more cheese than we realized.\n\nI love the People's Market so I would go back again but I'm a little scarred and will definitely double check with the order taker to make sure that any non-vegan items are specified to be left out on the ticket.\n\nTLDR: Ordered a vegan pizza and the cook put real cheese on it. Tip for customers - make sure the order ticket specifies to leave non-vegan items off of the food item to be sure."

It's seasonal, so get it before it's gone.\nIt's a huge place, so it would be easy for families with kids to be able to find seating and room to spread out. Also a great place if you want to get some work done on your laptop.\nIt's refreshing to be able to come here on the weekends and not have to wait in a long line and also be sure to get a seat. There is a large free parking lot across the street. It's also on the light rail line. I've been to other nearby coffee shops where there are always issues with long lines, lack of seating, and lack of parking. And I'm not sure if it's worth it at those places."

I had ordered a vegan buffalo wrap which had king oyster mushrooms dipped in buffalo sauce as the protein. While I love mushrooms, I don't like my wraps fully mushroom-fied. I think I was expecting the wrap to be filled with seitan or something, so this did not meet my expectations. My husband ordered a chicken buffalo wrap, and he didn't love his either.\n\nI did see that there was a coffee shop & they also had a bagel on their menu, both of which I was eyeing. I also love that they have a bar in the middle of the restaurant. Will be back to hopefully give it a better rating!"

There was not any one manning the food counter, you had to order at the coffee bar. It was nice to have vegan options, but the food could be improved a bit. My wrap was very greasy. As for the atmosphere, someone has spent a lot of time trying to make it fun coffee House vibe. It's cute, but it was so noisy that we had to eat outside because we couldn't carry on a conversation."

The space was beautifully reimagined from its prior design bringing in more contemporary elements of what we loved about The People's Market's original location, elements we loved about the former business in this location, and some new inspiration.\n\nPastries are baked daily, and you can even watch the pastry chef at work. The lunch counter menu has very reasonable offerings, and is ready for pickup very quickly. We loved our cheeseburger (a relatively simple double patty smashed cooked perfectly for what it was), our chicken torta (with a slightly artistic presentation but still simple and approachable), and French fries that would've come around $25, but we ran a tab and went from coffee to tea and seltzer throughout the afternoon.\n\nShould you stay for a beer, there's an array of local taps. While there is not an excessive dried goods offering like some sundries/delis/ markets around town, there is plenty to choose. Additionally, the reach-in cooler space is full of items to enjoy on-site like alternative non-alcoholic beverages and local beers or take with you too like pasta and provisions dinners.\n\nEasy to get in and out with street parking in addition to the parking lot across the street. Walking distance to many other shops, restaurants, and bars. One of the closest walks from Novant Health Presbyterian /Hemby Children's Hospital campus, Central Piedmont Community College. There is a CATS /LYNX gold line stop right in front of the place.\nSafe to say that I would recommend."

Highly recommend visiting this place! Great atmosphere, great food and great vibes. They offer breakfast all day along with lunch food. Breakfast is my favorite food so I'm glad to see a nice variety of it. Overall, we loved it and will return back for sure."
