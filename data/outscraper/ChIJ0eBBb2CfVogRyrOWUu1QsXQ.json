Portion sizes are on the smaller side as well.\n\nWhere they really fall short though is the service. It's ridiculously slow. When they're not busy it still takes forever to get your food, regardless if you put an order in ahead of time or not. And if they are busy, forget about it. Super disorganized and they seemingly prioritize Uber eats and those sorts of orders over people who were already there or people who are waiting to pick up their online order. Having to wait 45+ minutes for a simple breakfast sandwich or some rice and chicken or a pizza, that I already ordered, is not fun. This isn't just my experience. I've seen people wait and complain about long wait times every time I've been here. It's a regular thing for them."

TLDR: i wont be back... can't recommend.\n\nI like knowing where i stand with people, and people's market let me know i cant stand with them. So its easy to not go back.\n\nId rather starve a few hours or walk over to hawthornes, menya, or even 7th street deli.\n\nOrdered coffees, a pizza, and fries, and a sandwich ( i try to block out bad experiences and this was 2 months ago, so its a bit tough to remember the specific order, but it was the experience that mostly didn't do it for me).\n\nThe food was alright (pizza was very meh, and i dont know how you can mess up fries, but there i was throwing money in the trash cuz i didn't finish those cold pieces of potatoes)... but the person at the register could only have been less helpful if she had just walked away and let me do everything. So there i was struggling to make it work holding my order.\nNo offers of a straw, a carrying thing for coffees, a bag... i had to ask for each thing and handle it myself... it wasn't busy, not like they couldn't have done just a little more...\nThis is why i hate to tip when i order (regretfully i did and just chalk it up to a lesson learned by not revisiting), because you never know what kind of service or food you will get until after..."

She took the time to thoroughly explain the menu and all available options, which was incredibly helpful for a first-time visitor like me. Her friendly demeanor and genuine enthusiasm made the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nThe highlight was the mocha latte she prepared--hands down one of the best I've ever had! The balance of flavors was perfect, and the care she put into making it was evident in every sip.\n\nThanks to Maleeka's exceptional hospitality and skill, I am already looking forward to my next visit to The People's Market. Highly recommend stopping by for excellent service and amazing coffee!"

Very accommodating since my last visit.\n\nVegan Philly (V) - Overall, it's good. It's just impossible beef with condiments - exactly as described, which I appreciate. It does need a little more \"pizzazz\" like seasoning (herbs & spices are vegan - idk why restaurants are afraid to use them) , lettuce, tomatoes... Etc. However, I must admit that I prefer it slightly more than the Beyond Steak. Nevertheless, my previous comment still stands and I highly recommend they make this more like a \"chopped cheese\" since its Impossible Burger with the chunks not being so big  but can still call it a Philly since it's just chopped meat anyway.\n\nVegan Fried Chicken (V) - It's GOOD AND SEASONED (I need to know their secrets lol) and the flavors work well together. The only problem is the oyster mushroom stem. They fry the entire thing but the stem is too rough and inedible. I wish they would cut it off. I've cooked these mushrooms before and you can cut most of it off leaving the rest intact.\n\nI really do like this place, and they do a good job but I think some minor adjustments could make certain menu items much better."

They seemed welcoming and especially accommodating when dealing with my 4 year old son.  Who, at the time, was intent on dismantling their Christmas tree.\n\nThe selection of baked goods was phenomenal.  My lil guy was thrilled with the Chocolate donut, covered in icing and sprinkles.\n\nI went back a couple of days later and had a smashburger from the grill. It was delicious.\n\nI will admit, the sandwich did not come as ordered... (keep in mind my toddler was staging considerable distractions) I asked for a \"Bacon BBQ burger\"without pickled onions, and ended up with a \"People's smash burger\" which had a hefty load of pickles on it...\n\nEven with that easily understandable error, the burger was pretty great.  I have to imagine the other sandwich would've been even more enjoyable.\n\nWe'll be back soon"

It was so slow that it wasn't even allowing devices to connect--therefore it was down and generally would prompt looking into. The frustrating part is there was no way for me to know this without asking, and when I did ask the cashier seemed very annoyed and dismissive, and acted like I was being rude for asking. If you're tired of people asking about it, maybe simply put up a sign over the WiFi sign saying that it's slow/not working.

While there on 9.20.24 I wasn't thinking and curled my legs up with the tops of my feet touching the couch I was on. Bottoms of my feet weren't touching the fabric. (I had been wearing flips flops & I was fresh from the shower - I get no one could have known this but just so you know I hadn't slogged through dust and mud.) I also get this isn't what you do at a place of food. I had a good book; I was in another world. A person with blond curly hair stood a couple feet away and said 'this is a restaurant, you can't have your feet on furniture. You have to wear shoes.' She/They weren't wrong; I corrected myself immediately. But I was embarrassed in front of others. I'm no snowflake, but I did have a rough week. I'm autistic and my nervous system was raw. She couldn't have known any of this, nor is it her responsibility to take care of, but she could have been less public in her approach. She also didn't introduce that she worked there. Until I asked, I thought she was a patron who had been drinking at the bar; she had been sitting there for the first hour I was there. I first thought she was just another patron who maybe was over-stepping because alcohol. (To be clear I didn't give much heed to what drink or food was or wasn't in front of her. It's a bar so I just figured.)\n\nThis \"complaint\" isn't crazy deep, but be considerate when you have to correct someone. You're human, but so are the people who patronize your digs. "

The woman was extremely rude to my friend who never received a deli item she ordered and treated us like we were stupid the entire time we were trying to explain what the situation was, and gave off the impression that she thought we were lying or trying to scam them out of money. She refused to acknowledge our proof of the purchase going through through apple pay along with the text we were sent that the food was ready for pickup, and hardly made an effort to find the order on the P.O.S system while doubling down that there's simply no way the order was mistakenly put under a different name as I suggested. After a much too long back-and-forth with her very clearly not being interested in helping us figure out what had happened, she storms off pissed saying \"whatever i'll give you your refund,\" finally asks for our number to look up to find the order (why couldn't she have just done that from the start???), and sees that we were right and that it was under a very different name.\n\nThere was absolutely 0 reason to treat your customers like they're stupid - she approached the situation from the start very agitated like we were guilty of something and was being very disrespectful with how she spoke to us. I have worked customer service for years and I cant imagine interacting with guests like that who had approached being polite and just wanted their problem fixed. I was looking forward to showing my friend this spot, but the entire experience left us both feeling weird."

The entire Elizabeth neighborhood is very cool with lots of restaurants and bars as well as trolley service that runs throughout.\n\nI had the ham and cheese croissant and it was excellent! Whatever cheese they use in that thing is special. I also had a peach blossom iced tea with elderberry syrup and I was tempted to get a second.\n\nThe bakery is on the left. The bar is in the center, and the order and pick up window for savory foods is on the right. You can order food while sitting at the bar as well.\n\nI really enjoyed the openness of the space as well as all the natural light. The garage doors are probably fun to open in the spring and fall. Since they have a kids menu, I'm excited to bring my whole family back to enjoy it!"

And it wasn't very big. But was reasonably priced.\n\nThe atmosphere was a mix of people meeting up and working like me. I was able to work until my computer battery got low. I didn't see an outlet so I packed up and went to another coffee shop. But that was really my only gripe. Not worth knocking a star though cause I probably needed to move and make room for others anyway. "

I had an iced oat milk latte with vanilla and it was perfectly creamy, nutty, and sweet.\nThis seems like a really nice place to stop in for a bite, a coffee, a snack, or even a bottle of wine to take home. They also have a bar in the middle which seemed to have beer on draft. I also saw plenty of people there to work on laptops and collaborate with others (there is a conference room possibly able to be rented?) so it would be an awesome place to get work done, hang with friends, or grab something to go.\nThere is also parking for Elizabeth St. shops just across the street!"

I tend to avoid uptown because of parking, but this place was well worth it. I parked on the side street but later saw a parking lot across the street.\n\nI sat at the bar because it was the first thing I really noticed when I walked in. It was mildly busy that day. There were so many smiling faces, and the staff immediately assisted me when I stated it was my first time in.\n\nI ordered the vegan platter (yes, of course, I want the sausage with it) and a lavender vanilla latte with oat milk.\n\nLater, before leaving, I went to the bakery, which is located right inside and to the left and got the donut (vanilla birthday cake) and muffin (chocolate chip). The vegan and gluten-free were on the top shelf and clearly labeled in the case #win\n\nBack to the meal... I ordered and paid at the bar and was told to wait for the text that I would receive when my order was ready. I was directed to the back of the store for the food and the bakery for the coffee, but the bartender grabbed and delivered the items directly to me (so many thanks!)\n\nThe food automatically came in to go containers. I appreciated that because it made it easier for me to go from the bar to a table to work (no laptops were allowed at the bar 10a-2p.\n\nI completely enjoyed everything I ate! It was flavored and cooked to perfection \n\nTo say I'll be going back there is an understatement! You'll have to try this place! There are plenty of vegan options, and the price was VERY good for brunch!\n\nNot a full 5 stars because I asked for iced water, and the staff at the bakery counter told me to get the water from the community container. It's awesome that they offer this, but there was no ice.\nAlso, they had me pay on a device and left the device in front of me for most of my meal. It was awkward and made me feel like I was supposed to do something more."

The bowl was filling by itself. The grits were on point; the food was still hot when delivered. The fruit was fresh. The drinks were hot, too. The jasmine was good, but I could use another apple chai on a cold day like today. I'd only had regular chai up to that point and wanted to try something different. It was very good.\n\nThe good reviews helped me decide to try them that day. Hopefully this one will help you decide, too."

The staff person who took our order was very kind and let us know that it would not be a problem which was perfect for me because I am lactose intolerant and have been vegan for 2 years. The pizza came out quickly and it was delicious. Unfortunately, we didn't realize it until we were done eating that the cook in the back put real parmesan cheese on top of the vegan cheese . We saw little white specks on the pizza as we were eating, but we also asked for the balsamic vinaigrette (which we know is vegan) and it has little specks in it so we thought it was that. However, after we completely devoured the pizza we saw dry white specks in the box that were definitely parmesan. I brought it up to John, one of the workers, and he was very responsive, apologetic, and offered to refund us for the pizza. I was okay with that and not super upset because I thought it was just a light sprinkle of cheese but shortly after we left People's Market at 6pm, I got the worst nausea, and I stayed up until 3am with terribleee stomach pain and a lot of mucus buildup. I have never felt that much stomach pain in my life. Apparently, there was way more cheese than we realized.\n\nI love the People's Market so I would go back again but I'm a little scarred and will definitely double check with the order taker to make sure that any non-vegan items are specified to be left out on the ticket.\n\nTLDR: Ordered a vegan pizza and the cook put real cheese on it. Tip for customers - make sure the order ticket specifies to leave non-vegan items off of the food item to be sure."

My favorite is the cinnamon roll croissant. On this occasion, I had the pumpkin waffle with brie whipped cream and candied pecans, which was outstanding. So delicious, it was worth the calories spent. It's seasonal, so get it before it's gone.\nIt's a huge place, so it would be easy for families with kids to be able to find seating and room to spread out. Also a great place if you want to get some work done on your laptop.\nIt's refreshing to be able to come here on the weekends and not have to wait in a long line and also be sure to get a seat. There is a large free parking lot across the street. It's also on the light rail line. I've been to other nearby coffee shops where there are always issues with long lines, lack of seating, and lack of parking. And I'm not sure if it's worth it at those places."

One of the best deli meals I've had in a long time and potentially the best I've ever had - and you can check my reviews, I frequent deli's as often as possible.\n\nThe atmosphere in here really cool, great vibe with a bar right in the middle. Easy ordering system and super friendly people working here. Not sure what they did to the sandwich, but it was perfect.\n\nCan't recommend this place enough. Now if you'll excuse me, I have an apple cinnamon donut to eat. "

I think I was expecting the wrap to be filled with seitan or something, so this did not meet my expectations. My husband ordered a chicken buffalo wrap, and he didn't love his either.\n\nI did see that there was a coffee shop & they also had a bagel on their menu, both of which I was eyeing.
