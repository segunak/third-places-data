The shop front is ON Franklin Blvd.\nOur GPS went kind of stupid when trying to find them. If you are heading WEST in Gastonia, Wilkinson Blvd, (or Hwy 74, or.  Andrew Jackson Hwy) turns into Franklin Blvd., (THE) Boulevard. AFTER you cross over the railroad tracks. Gilmore's is just a bit further on the Left. Look for the banners on the sidewalk in an older brick building on the left. Parking is between 2 buildings, slopes downhill and kind of a squeeze. You can probably park in a lot at the bottom of the hill. Ignore the names on the building...previous owners of the building. The name plaques are there to honor them and for ambiance. They roast their coffee In-House. Many choices in coffee. I like their Americano (their secret blend). They also have some infused olive-oils. We haven't tried that yet. Also, there's a lot of other neat items in the shop. I see a nice area for the kids to hang out in also. Check them out."

We got to see to the beast of a roasting machine they use in-house and she explained how the owner, Rachel, uses locally sourced beans. The place smells incredible, as you can imagine, and the coffee was delicious! So many roasts!\nOh - and did I mention the many oils and vinegars they have there that you can sample?! The strawberry balsamic was superb!\nTheir gift selection was quite ample. I picked up some luxurious Turkish bath towels for about $12 each. You CANNOT beat that! I also bought some fancy mint tea and an adorable locally crocheted snowflake ornament.\nWe came in just for coffee, but left with so much more; a real feeling a being part of the lovely Gastonia community.

It was so smooth it's almost sweet, even taking it black. These guys know their coffee.\nThey also have an incredible selection of infused olive oils and flavored vinaigrettes, a really nice array of teas and spices, just a really good one-stop shop for the kitchen staples at really affordable prices. Will be returning for another bag of the coffee, and more besides!"

Decided to see what it was all about since I was out of coffee at home. Delightful little store, family owned and run. I want to come back to enjoy a cup of coffee and sit for a while one morning. Many of my favorite things here: kitchen items (like Lodge cast iron), spices, teas, quality olive oil... And taste testing! Always fun. I was a little confused about parking as there are no signs indicating I am in the right place, but Google did not lead me astray."

There is a kids corner with books and blocks and several tables and booths and armchairs to get comfortable in. They roast their own coffee varieties - over 15 that I saw this morning. We have started buying our homebrew here and love it. They also have lots of cute country store type of items, like toys and candies. Other specialties include teas, fresh spices, and more than a few varieties of specialty cooking oils and vinegars. What a special place!"
