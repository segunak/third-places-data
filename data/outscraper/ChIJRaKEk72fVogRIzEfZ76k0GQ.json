It is a bit pricing my order altogether was $30. And it wasn't a tip I have cheesecake, latte, and a mushroom toast. They did mention that everything is going to be fresh so I guess it does make sense but at the same time it doesn't. But that's just me\n\nThe guy did mess up my drink the first time when I asked for whip cream he put too much and spilled all over the cup. He thought that doubling the cup will help, but I do not want my drink spilling out my cup so I ask him to redo it again. The drink was pretty good. I should have asked him to put extra pumpkin syrup on it. I love my drinks very sweet. So 8 out of 10. Out of my latte.\n\nMy pumpkin cheesecake was delicious I ate that up like it was the last thing on earth. It was 10 out of 10\n\nAnd the mushroom toast is...excellent! Nothing was over cooked or undercooked they put some sauce on top of the eggs and mushroom that hit the spot really well.\n\nOverall, The place look really great I would recommend to come over here whenever you're in the area wherever you want breakfast, lunch, brunch, or get your wine sipping on. And I would definitely come back over here whatever I'm in the area. So this is definitely worth $30 and Moore if you want things fresh and ready."

I think the coffee was only $5ish dollars, so maybe a little pricey for the croissant but I think worth it. Probably couldn't be my daily thing at that price tho.\n\nThey also have some interesting choices in the shop area of ciders, sake and beer, a few I hadn't seen before.

            "review_text": "I stopped by The Everyday Market, a new gem in Lower Southend, after seeing it listed on the Goodie Bag app. This locally owned spot, which also has a location in Belmont, is conveniently nestled next to Phat Burrito and Yama LoSo. Despite its recent opening, I was impressed by the steady stream of customers. It's worth noting that parking can be tricky; there's complementary valet and a nearby paid parking garage if you can't snag some free street parking.\n\nUpon entering The Everyday Market, I was welcomed by a coffeehouse/wine bar ambiance, complete with soothing music. The cold beverage cooler caught my eye with an array of drinks, ranging from Mexican Cokes to my favorite Italian iced tea, San Benedetto. Further along, an array of freshly baked pastries tempted the palate, from pound cakes and macarons to cheesecakes and freshly made sandwiches. The next case showcased their freshly baked breads--focaccia, sourdough, and brioche--as well as muffins, croissants, and rugelach. They also offer soup and an impressive selection of wines, many available by the bottle. For the coffee enthusiasts, there's a range of options from cold brew to frappes, smoothies, lattes, and expertly crafted espressos.\n\nThe staff, especially Joel, were exceptionally friendly. His welcoming smile and engaging banter brightened my visit. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy, as well-behaved dogs accompanied their owners inside. If you're into wine tastings, they host them monthly at this location.\n\nFor my meal, I opted for the refreshing open-faced salmon toast. The combination of smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber slices, hard-boiled egg, arugula, and thinly sliced lemon, drizzled with a light balsamic glaze on sourdough, was delightfully refreshing--perfect for the upcoming summer. Interestingly, the bread wasn't toasted, which suited my preference for softer bread. I also enjoyed a mocha frappe, a perfect antidote to the heat and a great caffeine boost. The \"small\" size rivals a \"Grande\" at larger coffee chains, yet isn't overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nMy only suggestion for The Everyday Market is to add umbrellas for shade on the outdoor patio. That would make it my go-to spot for enjoying pleasant weekend weather on their patio with a made-to-order sandwich, a San Benedetto iced tea, and perhaps a freshly baked pastry. Here's to many more visits to The Everyday Market! Cheers!"
