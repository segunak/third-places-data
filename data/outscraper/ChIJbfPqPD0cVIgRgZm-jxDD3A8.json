And I'm not a person to get mad or write reviews but it has gotten too much. I'm writing this review because of this one female working bar on Monday 12/11/2023 at 11:03am. She had on a green sweater and she was about 5'3 she didn't have a name tag on. None of them did. As well as the lady working on window. They made my drink wrong and when I went back in to kindly ask for something they had missed in it, they proceeded to add the wrong thing, so I kindly asked for a remake and the girl got an attitude. While I was holding the drink trying to show her that she had missed the crunch toppings she proceeded to pour caramel brulee toppings on my hands. So rude! Please get her fired. I work in customer service and it's all about patience and kindness and if you don't posses these traits you shouldn't be working there. Go do something online where human interaction isn't needed."

If i get there and it's busy, I'll wait in line like everyone else My coffee was burnt so i had to go inside- defeats the purpose of using the drive thru....,and the chick making coffee was mad I asked for a remake. Like i should have been happy with a burnt iced drink. Then says \"throw it away outside cuz, yeah\". Rude. Don't spend your money at this location. It's worth it to just go where you're used to.

If you want your order to be a priority just wait in the drive through. Better to wait 15 minutes in the drive through than 30 minutes inside.

I pulled up to the window and they handed me a grande drink that didn't look anything like a shaken espresso. I let them know and they remade it. The remade drink tasted like milk. Not even a hint of coffee. Today I decided to give the location another try. I waited in line for 30 minutes. Ordered what I thought would be a simple drink so I wouldn't have the experience I had previously. It was supposed to be a venti iced white chocolate mocha. When I pulled up to the window, they handed me a venti hot drink. I was a little annoyed, but took it because the line behind me was long and I didn't want to make people wait. It's fine. I can drink it hot. I got down the road and took my first sip to find out they had served me a hot WATER. Do not waste your time coming here. There are so many other locations to choose from. This one will not get your drink right."

We'd already pulled off though, and just decided to see if they could fix it. We got back in the drive through line because we'd already been there for 20 minutes--whats another 10? Courtney, im assuming the team lead or Manager, gracefully and kindly offered to remake it. She also offered ideas about what may have happened, validated our concerns, and had excellent command in managing the situation. She  made sure we were happy and I appreciate that in this day and age. A little kindness goes a long way. I was visiting from florida and this experience was too good not to share.

It is a bright and bustling environment where the sun comes through the windows just right, but what really makes it special are the people there. My friends refer to it as, \"my sanctuary\". Some of my best memories, greatest connections, and longest hours studying have been found and spent here. And for good reason. For me this Starbucks is one where I can always find some happy. Huge shoutout to Courtney for being an absolute gem, memorizing my order, and always taking the time to say hello to me. You never cease to make my day :) As long as I am in Charlotte, I will keep coming back. I will never forget this place."

Today they didn't greet anyone, they didn't show enough support to their ne hires, they didn't speak loudly and clearly to their guests which is needed since they are wearing maskes. They treat not only myself poorly but the 3 people behind me as well. They don't take feed back well and would rather blame you for their lack of custo.er service. I've been here other days and it went better, you can't stop the ball especially this bad. Today I was delivering for uber eats and if it wasn't for my desire to provide superior service to my customers I would have canceled the order. Do better guys. Hopefully you learn to work together and provide 5 star service to your customers at the same time."

I came back today ( 10 days after ) and told her the situation and said it happened about two weeks ago and she said very rudely \" two weeks ago like really ? \" and I started to talk and she cut me off and continued to give me attitude saying she'd do it this time and then when we got to the window she told us 3 days is their policy and i apologized explaining to her i was told \" next time I stop in \" nothing was mentioned about 3 days to me. Once I drove away I took a bite of my sandwich and it was cold, they didn't even warm my sandwich for me because apparently it's my fault they forgot to give me my sandwich and I wanted either a refund or another sandwich.

I asked for a BLONDE espresso americano and she repeated my order and still got it wrong. I literally had to pour out my drink because it was so disgusting. I had such great service on the morning of 1/14/2021. I wish I could have gotten their names so I could tip them. They gave me an extra egg since I don't eat bread and made it into a sandwich for me.

I waited another 5min until I finally drove to the window for them to tell me they were close and that they open at 6.

My boyfriend ordered me a venti iced mocha macchiato\nAttached you'll find the recipe on their website the only modification is the soy milk. Apparently that was the most difficult drink they could've ever made. They ended up giving us a caramel macchiato with mocha drizzle (that they charged extra for). The day before I went to one of two of my usual locations and they had ZERO issues making the drink. They knew exactly what went in it so why was it so difficult for this location to figure out??? And what I really would like to know is if you didn't know how to make it why didn't you look it up and find out??  Customer satisfaction should be key. I've accumulated almost 1000 points in less than 6 months. The worst part about it is I tried calling while he was in the drive thru and their phone doesn't even work  I hate that there isn't consistent quality and training across the board for Starbucks. I will never return to this location and if I do I'm ordering the same exact drink and teaching them how to make it myself."
