They even have specialty drinks such as the Mangonada!). If you want to grab a bite to eat, I definitely recommend their Banh Mi's! The staff are also SUPER friendly and the place is pretty clean!

Even a good Starbucks isn't that much.\n\n2. Orders used to be accurate but now it's hit or miss depending on the day you order. I always order less sweet but the last 2 times the drink was so sweet I just couldn't drink it, so $18 down the drain. I may have been unlucky so will try in a few months and see.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's worth trying but the value and service proposition drove me away."

I requested the popcorn shrimp but they were out so I ordered the popcorn chicken I instead. The breading was different & probably would have tasted better but it was overcooked.\nThe vanilla bean Bubba tea with pearls (also called tapioca depending on where you order from) however it's all the same was good.\nThe staff was friendly and answered any questions I had about the menu. I will go back to try some more items before giving my final opinion."

Today, Thursday April 15, 2021 I always enjoy coming to Tea Fusion CAFE, they're the best by far I've ever experienced.. I usually get the #3MJ Mega Mango and the #S1 Popcorn Chicken, they ARE to die for in my book that's how good they are.. Service is always pleasant, and facial coverings are required.. I'm from the Columbia area and travel to and from just for these items.. I highly recommend you stop by and give Tea Fusion CAFE a try, you'll love it.."

In the many times I've been here, I have never waited this long before. They had full staff in the back running around prepping orders. Everyone who came in after were  getting their drinks and food before us. They could've at least given us our drink and let us know they are still prepping the sandwiches and it's going to take longer. Instead we had to wait almost an hour. Finally went to ask at the counter (I understand they were busy, but everyone it the back just kind of ignores you and don't even acknowledge or try to see if you need help when standing in front of the pickup counter) and was told they were still prepping the sandwiches. Finally got our order after a few minutes after we asked. If we didn't ask we probably won't ever get it.\n\nVery disappointed."

The tea refreshers are fine, it's the milk tea and tapioca that are just not worth it. We went yesterday and the drinks were just not good, the tapioca was straight up soggy. That last visit really confirmed it's unworthiness for all of us. Just disappointed because we went there several times to give it a chance. The reason they are hyped up is because of the aesthetic environment and the tea refreshers, which is good for them but please rethink how you cook your boba and make your flavors!"

The mason jar teas are amazing (not to mention super pretty and perfect for insta pics!) I typically order mine for dine in and then end up getting a to go cup for what I can't finish while there. Love that they seal the To go cups. Very reasonably priced."
