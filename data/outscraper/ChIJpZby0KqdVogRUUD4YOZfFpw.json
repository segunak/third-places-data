    "place_description": "Here at Waterbean Coffee, we always try to stay original and never follow the trends. In a time when most coffee shops focus on getting the customers in and out of their doors the quickest, we try to give them a place to relax, hold meetings, go over schoolwork, or just hang out with friends. We want to be more than just another coffee shop. Our founder\u2019s international background brings a unique aspect to the space that most people don\u2019t have. This is reflected from our menu options all the way down to our store designs. One of Tony\u2019s favorite quotes is from Henry Ford: \u201cQuality means doing it right when no one is looking.\u201d",

The two baristas were very welcoming and knowledgeable, giving their opinions on the various beans, sharing their preferences and how/what they brew at home, to help me find the right choice. And when they brewed espressos, going from one coffee to another, they took the time to make sure to dial it in right to present a quality drink, well-worth the time and money."
