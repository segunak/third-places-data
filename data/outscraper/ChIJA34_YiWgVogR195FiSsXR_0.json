But for $6 + tip, this coffee is clearly cheaply made to pursue the most profits. I wish I could say it wasn't but at that inflated of a cost, I'd expect a much better taste rather than the darker, slightly burnt quality. Tastes more like concentrate than a true cold brew."

Gave me the coffee and surprise, there was foam. I asked her to please remake it and she did very angrily I might add and it had foam again. I informed her that she only had to use a spoon to strain the foam off when pouring the steamed soy milk but she was not interested. I combined the two coffees myself removing the foam which resulted in less than half a cup remaining from the two coffees to be discarded. Perhaps she was having a bad day but unfortunately in the service industry the customers should not see your attitude. Siri and will definitely be avoiding this coffee shop moving forward."

If you are not, you will have to find parking on the street( which will likely have a  cost!).\n\nWhen we walked in there were ample staff at the counter. I ordered an unsweetened  matcha latte with oat milk. I love the fact that they offer both a  pre- sweetened and a non sweetened option! My drink was made quickly.\n\nWe opted to dine in to enjoy the unique seating options. They have  a sitting area that is directly on the stairs. They have pillows  out for a little extra cushion. It's such a  vibe!\n\nIn addition to the cute vibe, they have a small retail  section.  They  had a number of flavored syrups for sale and popcorn.\n\nIf you are in the area I would strongly suggest stopping on."

While the flavor was full bodied, the presentation and blend wasn't worth a second attempt.\n\nHats off to Marriott for branding Coco, but I would consider this a coffee house nor a Co-Lab as it is branded.\n\nShould you find yourself in the fourth ward, Charlotte uptown, you may want to explore a little more, and find an alternate place to enjoy a cup."

They have a wide selection of drinks and food, from lattes and smoothies to sandwiches and pastries. The pastries are delivered fresh from a local French bakery every morning, and they are delicious. I especially love the banana bread and the croissants. The coffee shop has a cozy and modern vibe, with plenty of seating options. They have a loft-style second level, a stadium seating area, and a co-lab space for local makers and community collaboration. The location is also great, right in the heart of Uptown, inside the Marriott Hotel. I highly recommend Coco and the Director to anyone who loves coffee and good vibes. 5 stars!"

Despite adequate staffing, service is especially slow for no reason. I've  witnessed people walk out of line when they were next.  The food is marginal and they replaced the divine Sugarman cronuts with their own knock off version that is essentially, tasteless sugar dough. They likely capitalize on the flow between the hotel and corporate building, but they will be in for the fight of their lives once this large food court area opens in the same building/block. Overpriced and under-delivering."

My husband got a regular drip coffee which tasted like nothing. I ordered an Americano with sugar free vanilla. I watched the barista pour wayyy too much syrup in the cup (I was a barista for 5 years so I have a good idea about how much goes in a 16oz cup) and then watched 2 or 3 more drinks that were ordered after me get made and handed out before mine. They were relatively busy, with a line of 3 people pretty consistently, so I don't mind waiting for my coffee in those situations. However, the drink was so gross it didn't redeem the wait. I had my husband try it to make sure I wasn't being overly critical and he suggested I throw it away. We left and tossed our drinks and went to another coffee shop. Won't be visiting this spot again."

First incident was with a blond girl wearing a hoodie with a rainbow at the front counter; second incident was with a black man at the front counter.\n\nProblem A: Both times when I asked for my drink of choice (\"Could I have a ____\") they responded with something to the rude tune of \"Yeah no.\" The second encounter I was thrown off by how dismissive he was; both times they just kept staring at me like I was the one who was foolish. How am I supposed to know what's out of stock? That's your job to inform me, do so respectfully, and perhaps offer a suggestion. So instead had to re-pivot and offer a second choice, without any input from them. Again just poor customer service based on their reactions.\n\nProblem B: In that second incident, after I ordered, I moved to the right to wait for my order; a customer came over afterward and told me she had heard the blond girl and black man (at the front counter) talking smack about me. They were condescending to what I was wearing and how I wasn't entertaining their flippant manner with my demeanor.\n\nSeriously have these two ever gone through customer service training? How can the Marriott endorsement this terrible behavior? The baristas here used to be so sweet (one used to remember my name) and now they're moody, condescending, and just awful to deal with. Will happily take my money to Night Swim or the cafe in the Ritz. Bye bye."

Ordered a chocolate muffin as well, waited 10 minutes before anyone said anything to me (mind you it took close to 5 just for the latte and there was one couple in front of me). The guy who asked had just gotten there while the guy who took my order was ready to leave but got told to clean lids and straws.\n\nThe environment is cool and plenty of seating. A very relaxed vibe. But the tables near the window hadn't been cleaned.\n\nIt's in a great location, especially for people at the Marriott, but not worth more than one visit.\n\nAlso...$15 for a French press!?"

You could come here to team up/work with others and pursue a spot first floor or wind up going through the layered advance stages which were planned flawlessly. Incredible espresso and sublime cordial assistance. We even fiddled with a portion of the new fermented free leaf lemon ginger tea. Gathering top picks incorporate the morning meal sandwiches and biscuits and ice'd mocha. Mixed and worth the stop!"

That being said the coffee is Starbucks level quality while being 2 dollars more expensive, a bit burnt and very bitter. Nothing a little half and half can't fix but for an iced vanilla latte I expect it to be a bit better."
