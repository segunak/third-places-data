I googled coffee shops near me and was instantly attracted to the name \"Verb Coffee\" as my plan was a little caffeine and sustenance to get my body activated for the long day ahead. When you follow the gps to this location drive slow and careful as one wrong turn may set your arrival time back a few minutes and can lead to frustration. Anyway the parking lot has plenty of space. The atmosphere is very open, light, and calming. I came on a Friday afternoon and met Cameron. He was very welcoming and knowledgeable and just overall very nice and inviting person. I told him what my mood was  and he made his suggestions. I ended up drinking their cold brew and having a light avocado toast. Cameron explained most their products they use other local businesses to supply and I absolutely loved that. There is WiFi and plenty of space for students to hang out and get some work done. The pictures speak  for themselves.\n-Lydia Hamilton 11/9/2024 1:32pm\nInstagram: @shotsoflydi"

They do offer three more seating areas outside.\n\nWhile I'm not a big coffee person, I do love apple cider and they had an apple cider Chai on the menu. It was very good. I also order the eggs and hash. It was a bit on the small size yet good. Make sure to tell them how you want your eggs as they come over easy. It's a good local shop if you are in the area."

Drawn in by the inviting aroma of freshly roasted beans, I stepped inside and was immediately charmed by the warm, intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe space is small, but it exudes a welcoming vibe with soft lighting, exposed brick walls adorned with local art, and comfy seating that begs for lingered conversation. The barista greeted me with a genuine smile and a contagious enthusiasm for coffee.\n\nUnsure of their winter selection, I eagerly took their recommendation for a seasonal latte. Creamy, rich, and infused with warm spices, it was pure winter magic in a cup. My companion opted for a classic latte, equally delightful with its perfectly balanced espresso and steamed milk. Each sip was a testament to the quality of their beans and skilled brewing.\n\nBeyond the exceptional beverages, Verb Coffee shines with its focus on community. Local artwork graces the walls, and the barista took the time to chat with every customer who walked in, creating a friendly and genuine atmosphere. I left feeling not just caffeinated, but also connected to the warmth and energy of the space.\n\nWhether you're a coffee connoisseur or a casual latte sipper, Verb Coffee is a must-visit.
