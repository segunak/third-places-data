The bartender was super friendly and efficient when ordering drinks. Had plenty of knowledge of all the wines they had available and gave plenty of recommendations. I unfortunately failed when getting his name. we were able to try their charcuterie board with various meats and cheese, which were all tasty. They brought out an assortment of pepperoni, veggies, and salmon Flatbread, which were DELICIOUS!!!!!! ALL OF THE TAPAS style of food was delicious and no complaints. I never knew this place existed, but thanks to Yelp, now I know and will definitely be frequenting this place. It's such a great neat spot, and I'm glad Ashley from Yelp was able to get this this little setup for us."

Today, we decided to try the food and I have to say that we will be returning for everything else but the food. We ordered chips and salsa + guacamole and meatballs, totaling to $25. The guacamole was quite honestly just avacado and tomatoes with nothing else. There was more tomato than avocado and the avocado looked not fresh. I have had the same Tostino chips AND salsa before so whatever this was was not fresh or homemade. The meatballs were 100% frozen previously and microwaved and were very chewy and overcooked. I was highly disappointed to have paid $25 for such low quality food. I am normally not critical of food, but this was extremely underwhelming. Knowing how good the coffee and drinks normally are at this place, it was very disappointing to have eaten this food. If I had to leave some advice for management, it would be to use fresh ingredients and serve something you would actually pay to eat."

I recommend the avocado toast or yogurt bowl for breakfast/brunch (two of my favorites), and their Italian panini or avocado and turkey panini for lunch.  Their greek yogurt is some of the best that I have ever had. Their pastries are also outstanding. The staff is warm and kind and recognize familiar faces.  Great for staying and eating inside (or outside) with friends, or ordering pick up or a quick coffee and sandwich if you're on the run.  Has a dog friendly outside area with a water bowl and treats. 100% recommend! Love it."

I went to this place based on a referral I received from the owner of Ilios Crafted Greek and I'm so glad I did! If you want an amazing Greek coffee (rather difficult to accomplish in my book), this place is a must. I had the Freddo Cappuccino which is a double iced espresso with frothed milk and it was absolutely amazing. The quality of coffee, richness of flavor and authentic Greek coffee taste makes it one of my new favorites. I plan to try the frappe next and then migrate to a few of the hot coffee options.\n\nI went back for a second time to check out their food and was very pleasantly surprised. The turkey avocado panini is everything I would have expected with the perfect blend of seasoning and ingredients so every item of the sandwich could be tasted without one thing overwhelming the others. My colleague ordered the Greek Toast and said it too was perfect and exactly what he was hoping for.\n\nWe also ordered the sundae crepe which of I were on vacation, I would literally eat every day of the vacation. The cookie interior was perfect without being too much frosting or cookie. The crepe was perfectly fine and the gelato on top literally made it the perfect dessert for all ages. I will absolutely be back for more!\n\nIf you are looking for a place with amazing Greek coffee and delicious desserts while also serving great quality and healthy food (to justify The desserts and coffee), I would highly recommend checking this place out! The desserts are definitely what is drawing most people along with the amazing Greek coffee, but with food that's delicious as well, it's worth adding to the list of spots to check out."

We had the cucumber bites appetizer...my compliments to the creator of this dish!  Soooo good!  We also had the Mediterranean Pita and it was so fresh and tasty and not too heavy. The tzatziki spread was delicious.  My wife had the Apple Pecan salad and loved it.  Looking forward to tasting some of the desserts and authentic coffee. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed!!"
