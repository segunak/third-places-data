However now I am far more wary.  We are certain that the chicken had been mishandled.  Planning to take the chicken and some of the produce (used in the chicken salad) back today but I haven't seen a manager in this store in a couple of years.\n\nFresh market needs to fix this situation and also make sure that their managers are present on the floor and available for issues."

This year, due to covid 19 my table will not be full  of guests. I ordered a 4 bone. When I opened it I was surprised to find a slab of meat laying on its side. There were 4 bones but one was broken. The roast was not Frenched as in the past. Therefore, the roast will not end up looking like years in the past. I pride in having a nice looking table but this piece of meat is terrible looking. All I can hope is that the taste is as before"

            "review_text": "When I first walked into the store, an employee greeted me with \"fresh off the block,\" whatever that means.  The only thing I truly enjoyed about my visit was when I approached the meat counter.  Eric had exceptional customer service.   He was able to enlighten me of some of the perks of keeping up with emails through the Fresh Market Program.  Laura, my cashier, did not greet me when approaching the register and was throwing my glass milk cartoon around.  I had to ask if she broke anything, she rudely replied, \"NO.\"  It was near the end of my order, and I sarcastically said, \"Well, hey, how are you?\" because she never opened her mouth to say a word to me.  This transaction took place at around 8:00 pm on 07/01/2020.  Very disgusted at what Laura believed what \"customer service\" is and mainly frustrated at the management (Mark Catapano) for allowing an employee to treat their guest with such disrespect. Perhaps, during your next team meeting or before store opening and closings- coaching your staff on the do's and don't's of customer service is highly recommended."

The worst experience thus far when ordering from them. I'm listing publicly as I have tried to contact management to let them know, I don't want a refund I just want them to be aware that quality control perhaps failed this time around, but I have been kept on hold endless minutes and haven't been able to reach anyone who would listen.

Doesn't seem to be a higher demand for the product at that time, or a shortage of croissants at that time of year. So it just seems petty to stop offering it? An explanation would help. Thanks\n\nEdited due to reply\n\nThanks for replying April. I can understand that. I would challenge your group to look at wether certain specials really would impact in a negative way any holiday business above normal business, and I would doubt it to be so. So it probably costs more to suspend the specials than not to, imo. But I appreciate the reply and explanation!"

I asked one worker if she was the one who was going to make my sandwich and she snarled, \"when I'm done making my pizza\"   .  There was noone waiting for a pizza and no need to be so rude. I have ordered sandwiches on several occasions and never do they get the order correct or deliver within a reasonable amount of time. Waiting over 30 mins for 4 sandwiches (only got three) is absurd.  When I asked for my fourth sandwich the response was, \"oh someone else must have taken it\"  .  After that dismissal the employee walked away!!!  Thank God Whole Foods opened up. They understand that the customer not only wants a good product but helpful and competent service too.  If you want an occasional smile or a friendly greeting or if you want basic competent service you will not find it here. I have looked and since they opened I am yet to find it."

It was much larger and more expensive than I had asked for and was not cleaned/trimmed as they said they would do.  Had lots of pieces tied together.  I am very disappointed!"

The prepared foods are great. The fruit is delicious. I love the party trays and holiday meals. I have one BIG issue that will deter me from going to Fresh Market. There are no areas in the parking lot in which to leave the empty carts. Therefore, when I'm not well, hurting or the weather is in climate, what to do with the empty cart? I'm certainly not going to walk all the way back to the store. I shouldn't have to. Therefore, I can NOT patronize or I can leave the cart to float around the lot rolling into cars like my car was dented by a run away cart driven by the wind. It's an easy fix, spend a few $$$ to install cart holders."
