He was able to enlighten me of some of the perks of keeping up with emails through the Fresh Market Program.  Laura, my cashier, did not greet me when approaching the register and was throwing my glass milk cartoon around.  I had to ask if she broke anything, she rudely replied, \"NO.\"  It was near the end of my order, and I sarcastically said, \"Well, hey, how are you?\" because she never opened her mouth to say a word to me.  This transaction took place at around 8:00 pm on 07/01/2020.  Very disgusted at what Laura believed what \"customer service\" is and mainly frustrated at the management (Mark Catapano) for allowing an employee to treat their guest with such disrespect. Perhaps, during your next team meeting or before store opening and closings- coaching your staff on the do's and don't's of customer service is highly recommended."

We recently moved to Charlotte and our Thanksgiving order was perfect however, our Christmas tenderloin was terrible, I preordered a 6 lbs and when I went to pick up our order was handed an 8 lbs, not big deal if the filet would have been good, however after cooked and sliced we realized I paid almost 130.00 dollars for a piece of fat with some meat. The worst experience thus far when ordering from them. I'm listing publicly as I have tried to contact management to let them know, I don't want a refund I just want them to be aware that quality control perhaps failed this time around, but I have been kept on hold endless minutes and haven't been able to reach anyone who would listen. Very disappointed with our recent order."

And usually you buy a pound of it for $10 and you get a box of 4 great croissants for free, I've came to this and other fresh markets just for that deal many times. Then on Christmas Eve this year, I find out that the deal is suspended for the holidays. What? What kind of crazy thing is that lol. Doesn't seem to be a higher demand for the product at that time, or a shortage of croissants at that time of year. So it just seems petty to stop offering it? An explanation would help. Thanks\n\nEdited due to reply\n\nThanks for replying April. I can understand that. I would challenge your group to look at wether certain specials really would impact in a negative way any holiday business above normal business, and I would doubt it to be so. So it probably costs more to suspend the specials than not to, imo. But I appreciate the reply and explanation!"

I have ordered sandwiches on several occasions and never do they get the order correct or deliver within a reasonable amount of time. Waiting over 30 mins for 4 sandwiches (only got three) is absurd.  When I asked for my fourth sandwich the response was, \"oh someone else must have taken it\"  .  After that dismissal the employee walked away!!!  Thank God Whole Foods opened up. They understand that the customer not only wants a good product but helpful and competent service too.  If you want an occasional smile or a friendly greeting or if you want basic competent service you will not find it here. I have looked and since they opened I am yet to find it."

The prepared foods are great. The fruit is delicious. I love the party trays and holiday meals. I have one BIG issue that will deter me from going to Fresh Market. There are no areas in the parking lot in which to leave the empty carts. Therefore, when I'm not well, hurting or the weather is in climate, what to do with the empty cart? I'm certainly not going to walk all the way back to the store. I shouldn't have to. Therefore, I can NOT patronize or I can leave the cart to float around the lot rolling into cars like my car was dented by a run away cart driven by the wind. It's an easy fix, spend a few $$$ to install cart holders."
