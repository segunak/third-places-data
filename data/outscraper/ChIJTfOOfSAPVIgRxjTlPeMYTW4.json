Our employees raved about their space and all of the game offerings that they had available. They coordinated and ran two larger team-building events for us that were an awesome experience for our employees. We loved seeing the engagement and collaboration! They also had great food packages at a very reasonable cost for us to select from for the event. If you are considering this space for a corporate event I would highly recommend it to you on all levels! Nic, Alison, Jess, and the rest of their staff are wonderful!"

The pizza was great from a local vendor. Parking is very adequate for the building as it was very busy after we got there. Lot of people started trickling in and the entire hall was at capacity. Come early on Saturday like 530ish as you will maybe find a seat or you can reserve one online. There is a good selection of tables and chairs but they can go quick if it's a busy night. The games range from different categories and low to difficult on the game boxes. All games are returned to the table to be checked I assume and placed back where they belong on the shelf. We will return and it is recommended for a neat getaway from the norm."

            "review_text": "We stumbled upon Luck Factory in April of 2022 while visiting from the Atlanta area. My husband and I have played board and card games in the past so it sounded like a fun store to browse. That's all we initially thought we'd do- browse. Well , we ended up spending hours here on our first visit and had such an amazing time! Nick, the owner explained the store and table reservation system and the system for asking for help with a game. If you're not sure what kind of game you'd like and are open to suggestions he has an ingenious 3 question quiz for you to help you find that perfect game. We ended up learning Wingspan , King of Tokyo , and a few others that day and brought home a giant bag of new games.  I am not exaggerating when I say this spontaneous visit to Luck Factory  was the origin story to our current board game obsession and now we host monthly game nights back home. If we didn't live 4 hours away we'd absolutely be VIP Members! One thing you need to know - this place is special. Since returning to the Atalanta area we've scoured our area for something similar and while we've found a handful of places absolutely nothing compares to Luck Factory and how welcome we feel there , the level of help we can get if we need it , the friendliness of everyone who works there and the HUGE library of games to play. They are very family friendly ! The places near us all are fine but each lacks something. Either they cater solely to RPGs (we couldn't even get anyone to talk to us at one place bc we didn't apparently fit the look of their target customers) , or another place with super friendly people and large library but no one to help you learn new games, or lastly just a big store with only one tiny shelf of games to play. So clearly Luck Factory is a gem and if you're LUCKY enough to have this near you (or if visiting the area like we were) please go check them out. Even if you feel intimidated about learning a new game , Nick and his staff are such good teachers the way they explain things. You can learn simple or complicated games and be successful! To this day some of the games we learned at Luck Factory on that first visit and in subsequent visits since are still are go-to favorites- Wingspan, King Of Tokyo, Five Tribes , Splendor, Quacks of Quedlinburg and more. We joke that it's both good and bad that we live 4 hours away. Seriously go . Just go. Take a friend , take your family. Meet Nick, answer his 3 questions and find your next perfect game."

We were told that magic players got free entry friday and Saturday nights. So that following weekend my girlfriend and I came and had a blast playing magic with strangers. We bought beers and took home some goodies from the counter. A couple weeks later we came back with our family for another fun night. We played magic, bought beers and as we were closing our tab the total came out to nearly double what we had paid the previous time. We asked why and the lady said it was because of the entry fee. We said that we were magic players(expecting she'd give us the free pass like she had done the weeks prior) nope. She looked at us like we were crazy and trying to scam her. Keep in mind this is the same woman who told us about free magic nights.....as a customer I felt lied to, manipulated, and cheated. I had bragged to people about this place and was beyond excited to being the family. Never again. If the free Magic night was limited then say that. Pretending like it was never a thing is just plain wrong. Yall need to figure out whats real and what's not. Lying to a customer to promote your business is crossing the line."

I was impressed by the wide variety of games they had in the library. This is part of the Gibson Mill that they are redoing/remodeling a great addition and nothing really like it nearby. They even have membership options for the whole family if you guys like family game nights. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Plenty of parking, decent hours for now perfect place to spend on a rainy day."

The staff is super enthusiastic about their craft and take good care of their customers.\n\nA.couple of cool things that make them different from other game stores.\n\n1. They or their ambassadors will teach you the games and you can play before you buy.\n2. They have around 1000 different games to play so instead of taking a chance buying a game you haven't played., see if they have it and sample it.\n3.  It's a cafe. Eat,  drink be merry.   Where else can you enjoy a beer and a game.\n4. It's family friendly and safe.  I bright my kids and they had a blast."
