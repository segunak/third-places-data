After 10 minutes I was told that someone would be with me (because the only person working in the kitchen area had a door dash or one of those shady food delivery people behind the counter and he did not wash his hands when he went behind the counter either) after 6 more minutes  I left and will not be back. To be honest they were my least favorite overly priced coffee shop anyway but where way less busy so I made the mistake of going back. Now I know why they weren't as busy as the rest. You want  a good cup of coffee..... go to Mado."

I still feel passionately about this being my favorite coffee shop!!! Their pastry case is continuing to impress me more and more. Perrin has been doing a lot of the baking and I HAVE YET!! To try something short of delicious. Very excited they are able to do things in house and have been enjoying this development very very much. Coffee still the absolute best!!!"

Will give it another try if BoCo is closed, but recommend Mado Bakery for coffee and pastries."
