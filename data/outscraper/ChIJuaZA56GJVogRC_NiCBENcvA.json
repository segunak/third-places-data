I still feel passionately about this being my favorite coffee shop!!! Their pastry case is continuing to impress me more and more. Perrin has been doing a lot of the baking and I HAVE YET!! To try something short of delicious. Very excited they are able to do things in house and have been enjoying this development very very much. Coffee still the absolute best!!!"
