The aftertaste was overpowering, and I ended up with awful baby formula burps. To make matters worse, I felt so nauseous that I actually ended up throwing up shortly afterwards. This was a highly disappointing experience, and I hope management addresses this issue promptly."

Every guest's order is completed with speed and quality. With the great cook staff at this location, Devin is especially memorable to me as she always notices and recognizes me. She is sure to remember my order, and is pleasant in disposition despite the early morning."

I've noticed that more & more. I'd stopped tipping because my order was frequently wrong or not as requested. For example, a green goddess salad w/no chicken. Just a bunch of greens. Then I'd be mad that I'd left a tip. So I stopped for two reasons. 1) I eat there multiple times during the week bfast/lunch and 2) the probability that my order will be correct is pretty low. I'd usually have returned to work so my only recourse was to write corporate which made it right, but that's such an inconvenience. I ordered a sandwich from the Fairview Rd location yesterday after taking a break from them where I requested no mayo and sure enough it was slathered in mayo when I got it home. You'd think I'd wise up and check before I leave the store but nope. Got all the way home to discover it had mayo. Of course, I hadn't tipped either & likely won't again. Do better and you'll get tipped. You don't deserve a tip for almost getting it right or because you showed up. Panera ain't that cheap first of all particularly for those of us who order multiple times a day/week."

Went to the pick up counter get the befall. Asked the nice gentleman behind the counter if I could have a extra cream cheese (I'm well aware of the up charge) He handed it to me and the lady beside him says \"It's a up charge\" - I said okay. She repeated again I told her I'm aware ma'am and proceeded to the counter to pay. I got to the counter and the gentleman that gave me the cream cheese appears acting as if he's looking for something. I asked him if he was sent by the lady to make sure I paid. I could tell by the look on his face he was. I felt humiliated. I asked to speak with a manager. Gave my experience and probably will not come back to this location."

Today will be my last visit here as I was very disappointed the way things were handled by the Store Manager, Jasmine. When I left the location after eat-in around 9:15pm after it was closed at 9pm, all the left over breads and other bakery items were placed in a box for a donation or throw-away. Earlier I wanted to purchase Tomato Basil Miche loaf of bread, regularly sold for $8.19 plus Tax. The customer service rep offered me to sell it for $5. She took out loaf of bread from the bottom of the box and while ringing, the Store Manager, Jasmine came to close the register and made customer service rep to charge me full price of $8.78. I was very disappointed. When I asked customer service rep about her words of $5 deal (after Jasmine left), she mentioned to me that she was to offer me a loaf for $5 but suddenly Store Manager showed-up so customer service rep was helpless. So basically Store Manager charged me full price of the perishable item which was supposed to be discarded or donated !! Can you imagine how smart Panera Bread is hiring their Store Manager??? Also to add on, I had ordered a bowl of Soup among other items and the soup was cold. When I mentioned to chef on duty who made my full order of sandwich, he told me that I have to warm it up on my own in Microwave somewhere in Panera Bread cafe!!"

I placed my order 40 minutes before getting there to pick up. 5 minutes before my pickup time I got the text saying my order was ready....arrived on time and relayed that I was there. After waiting 10 minutes for an order that was ready I called to check on it with no answer. So I had to grab my child and go inside to grab my order that was sitting on the counter where food was being made. As I was leaving, the women behind me waiting (who had been there longer than me) was also grabbing her baby out of the car to go inside to get her curbside order. I know you were busy, but it looked as if curbside orders were just being ignored."

The manager told me when you order the bread bowl its a cup size, though your paying for a Bowl....Wow and since I already paid for the Bowl I need to return the bowl size and get the cup size in order to get the bread Bowl price......long story short that is cheating POINT BLANK.

They either 1) Bring it out 10 minutes later or 2) Leave it sitting inside for you to pick up (even though I definitely picked the curbside option). I go here often because it's convenient, but I always give myself extra time because you usually have to wait for quite a while. Recently,  I also ordered curbside and the parking lot was extremely full, so I had to park down the row towards the end. I saw the person come out with my order but they just looked at the cars right in front of the store (didn't see mine or even look down the row) and went back inside. I ended up just leaving because I was late to work."

If there is one, it is always dealt with swiftly.  The food is up to standards for a Panera Bread, and the location is very convenient for me.  Prices are a bit high, but no higher than other Panera locations.  All items, as well as the self serve soda fountain, are set out for customers, which takes away the burden of having to track down an employee to help with something minor.  Yet, staff is always responsive when needed.  Wait times are a bit long during lunch hour, but they do correspond to the amount of customers present, so this is understandable.  There is a nice screen near the to-go wait area that displays the order in which you may expect to be served, as well as how many people are ahead of you."

A simple question, such as 'is there anything else we can get you?', or 'thank you for coming to Panera Bread, hope you enjoy your meal.'\nIt's so easy to evaluate the level of experience at any establishment,  yet very few do so."
