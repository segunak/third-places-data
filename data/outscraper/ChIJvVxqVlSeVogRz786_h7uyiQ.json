Hey try to answer something again to me and I say No no  in a louder voice.( trying to stop saying rude thing to me)\n\nI came to him first trying to ask if he has the order, so I can stop him to make them all, but is when I received the first bad answer. So I go to the manager having a very good service and attitude to help me.\n\nThe manager and cashiier at the moment helps me in a great way! Good attitude!\nThanks."

No bright checkered floors or large replica Eiffel towers, just sweets, drinks and good vibes. The E36th local is definitely cool to visit but this one felt more like a cafe I could experience on the regular and less like a gimmick to draw in customers. I got Chai and the lemon raspberry tart, both delicious. Definitely coming back for that Chai tho "

We ate, laughed, and decided to return the next day with more friends to enjoy some celebratory, birthday treats.  If you are considering visiting Amelie's at Park Road, why not just go for it?  You may find a new, go-to spot.  Oh, and since we are macarons, it seems apropos to share this chandelier with you."

She said the hot chocolate was not great and her croissant was too toasted.\n\nI got the tiramisu, salted caramel brownie, and the quiche because I saw a lot of good reviews for the quiche.\n\nI didn't like the tiramisu. It was $6 and a very small slice. There is a thick layer of chocolate in it that I didn't like and it was just pretty bland aside from the chocolate.\n\nThe salted caramel brownie was good! It was also small, and more like a fudge than a brownie but I liked it a lot.\n\nThe quiche was $8 and the biggest disappointment. It is a generous slice but I didn't want to finish it. I got the quiche Lorraine. I think the only cheese was on the very top of the quiche, giving it a hard texture. The overall texture of the quiche was just dry and unpleasant. The middle was cold. I threw maybe half of it away.\n\nAll of the staff members I interacted with were very helpful and nice. There was a man giving out generous free samples of bread.

Very unfriendly and unwelcoming.  We ordered iced tea as well as several other purchases.  We paid and were told to listen for our name to be called for the tea.  We waited and waited.  We watched an employee on the phone, we asked about the tea three times.  We were told to wait and they would be right with us.  It was extremely disappointing the manner in which we were treated.  Your staff needs inspiration and guidance.  Hoping this will be helpful to you.  Thank you."

Instead\" When I told her that I paid the full price for the larger coffee, she changed her story and said \"oh no! I meant we are out of the 12 oz cups\" and then she walked away. I still have no clue what she was trying to communicate.\n\nI'll also mention that the coffee had zero favoring. It was obvious that she simply made 2 iced coffees with cream and sugar.

Drinks were very good, 4 espresso shots in iced fourcette was just what I needed. Very eclectic decor but lends to atmosphere. Bill came to almost $50 with tip. A little pricey for cafeteria style dining, get your own utensils and condiments. Worth a visit for pastries and drinks."

I ordered a build your own sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese. The sandwich came out with a cold sausage patty, clearly frozen and put in the microwave....which was completely inedible. If you're not going to make your own sausage, at least make sure it's heated up LOL. I will not be returning nor do I recommend it to anyone."

            "review_text": "I'm going to try and be very honest here, because I love Amelie's and I wanted to love my experience today.\n\nI am a born Charlottean who has since moved away, and I was back in town for a brief few days and I knew I wanted to show this place to my partner. The last time I went to Amelie's, it was the original flagship location in NoDa. I even took a small group of women there for my bachelorette party back in the day. I see now that there are several locations now and that the original has moved, which is very exciting.\n\nThe Park Road location recreated the original spirit very well and I felt at home when I walked in. It was a Sunday morning, so it was very busy. The staff seemed a little panicked, and the line was very long. We had ordered ahead and picked up our breakfast sandwiches when we arrived--they were ready to go and very yummy!\n\nHowever, the pastry I had ordered was sold out. I was a little disappointed because it initially was \"orderable\" online, and I noticed that for the online ordering system for Amelie's, items that are sold out appear grey and unelectable. So I was able to select this one and order it, but it was actually sold out. Oh, well. The problem is, I have Celiac's disease and also some minor issues with almonds and chocolate. So there wasn't really anything I could replace that order with.\n\nHere's where the service made me a little sad; when we went to pick up the pastries at the counter, the text we received told us to pick them up \"at the bar,\" but they weren't at the bar, they were at one of the cash registers. It was then that we found out that the creme brulee was sold out. We asked the gentleman at the register if I could switch it out with something else, and he sort of snapped at us. He said, \"Yes, you can do that but I can't help you, I have to get my drinks out,\" and immediately walked away. Didn't pass on the information to another server, didn't even really take time with us. I saw that he was working on coffee drinks and he seemed sort of distressed. He also attempted to hand my partner the wrong drink at one point.\n\nI'm a former barista and I get the panic behind a backup of drinks. However, I just don't think this was good service. Bare minimum, he could have taken a little more time to be friendly with us or offer a different solution. We didn't feel welcome, just felt as if we were an imposition. It definitely wasn't the special, celebratory feeling I remembered from the original shop. If the staff is stressed out on a weekend morning, more staff should probably be hired and scheduled.\n\nWe ended up leaving with sort of a bad taste in our mouth. Now, anybody could see, the demand was high. There was a line out the door pretty much the whole time, which I get can be stressful on servers. But--yeah. We were left feeling disappointed."

            "review_text": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It first started up on 10 September 2008, and remains the latest addition to CERN's accelerator complex. The LHC consists of a 27-kilometre ring of superconducting magnets with a number of accelerating structures to boost the energy of the particles along the way.\n\nInside the accelerator, two high-energy particle beams travel at close to the speed of light before they are made to collide. The beams travel in opposite directions in separate beam pipes - two tubes kept at ultrahigh vacuum. They are guided around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field maintained by superconducting electromagnets. The electromagnets are built from coils of special electric cable that operates in a superconducting state, efficiently conducting electricity without resistance or loss of energy. This requires chilling the magnets to -271.3degC - a temperature colder than outer space. For this reason, much of the accelerator is connected to a distribution system of liquid helium, which cools the magnets, as well as to other supply services.\n\nReplacing one of the LHC's dipole magnets (Image: Maximilien Brice/CERN)\n\nThousands of magnets of different varieties and sizes are used to direct the beams around the accelerator. These include 1232 dipole magnets, 15 metres in length, which bend the beams, and 392 quadrupole magnets, each 5-7 metres long, which focus the beams. Just prior to collision, another type of magnet is used to \"squeeze\" the particles closer together to increase the chances of collisions. The particles are so tiny that the task of making them collide is akin to firing two needles 10 kilometres apart with such precision that they meet halfway.\n\nAll the controls for the accelerator, its services and technical infrastructure are housed under one roof at the CERN Control Centre. From here, the beams inside the LHC are made to collide at four locations around the accelerator ring, corresponding to the positions of four particle detectors - ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb.\n\nExplore the CERN Control Centre with Google Street View (Image: Google Street View)\n\nvideo\n\nimage\n\nLHC Facts and Figures\n\nThe Safety of the LHC\n\nvideo\n\nimage\n\nVirtual tour of the LHC\n\nStatus of the LHC in real-time\n\nThis website uses cookies that are either necessary or that measure\n\nSETTINGSACCEPT ONLY NECESSARYACCEPT ALL"

I complained to the woman at the register and she said \"yeah...that's the manager.\" As if that justifies his treatment of customers. I understand this location can get extremely busy. We get that, and we're patient. But, the least they can do is respect their customers. There needs to be better processes in place for those waiting for their drinks.

            "review_text": "Came here TWICE this past week because the parents were in town and recently discovered Amelie's. We really enjoyed both visits!\n\nThe Good: first, the ambience is super cute! Kind of reminds me of an antique shop with French flair. As for the food, we all really enjoyed everything we tried. We tried several macaroons and multiple tarts. The tarts were the MVPs as they were delicious and not too sweet. The macaroons were also really good but were too sweet for all of us (none of us eat much sugar so we're all probably too sensitive to it). We also got some crustless quiches and chicken salad on croissant. My favorite was the chicken salad sandwich. The chicken wasn't fatty or gristly and seemed to be all white meat, which is my preference. The croissant was also insanely delicious and not stale as other reviews have mentioned. In fact, all of our pastries and food both times seemed to be really fresh.\n\nThe Meh: service wasn't the friendliest (except for the super nice lady who brought out our food - she was awesome). The ordering structure is confusing for newbies (see below) and I felt like the people working the pastry counter were impatient with us. There's a lot to look at within the pastry area and it may take some time to decide. They weren't busy when we came shortly after opening but I felt rushed making a decision on pastries.\n\nThe Bad: if you're new to Amelie's the ordering structure/process isn't clear and is confusing. One person takes pastry only orders and if you want anything else besides something in the pastry case, you have to place that order with a different person at the register. I get it but clear direction and patience would be appreciated. Apparently, if you order coffee, that comes out in the coffee bar area and not with your food. I think they call your name when your coffee order is ready but, due to the acoustics of the restaurant, I didn't hear a thing. Eventually, after I was almost done with my meal, I went in search for my latte and it was sitting on the counter. It would have been better if the cashier had let us know to watch out for our name or coffee at the coffee bar but I expected it to come out with my food. Like I said, I understand the structure of the food, pastry, coffee areas but staff were not helpful in communicating the process.\n\nOverall, we really enjoy the food and the ambience so we will definitely be back when my parents come back!"

If it were not for decent pastries and good coffee, a zero star rating would be more accurate. However, the pastries are seriously over priced.\n\nAmelies is not a good choice for those who only want coffee. The set up forces all customers to wait in what can be a very long and very slow moving pastry counter line. Even though there is potential for their second register to allow a separate coffee service line enabling better service to all customers, management refuses to implement this.\n\nA friend I was with today wanted to bring this up again to the manager on duty and was met with obnoxious rudeness and unprofessionalism. The manager stated in a snarky tone that \"it is what it is and that there was a Starbucks up the road if he didnt like it.\" I was shocked that a manger would act this way.\n\nWe took the managers suggestion and left. They lost 4 customers today. I will not give them my business ever again."

There's also a lack of consistency between the stores. :(\n\nUpdate from 3 years ago:\nThe Park Rd. location pleasantly surprised today.
