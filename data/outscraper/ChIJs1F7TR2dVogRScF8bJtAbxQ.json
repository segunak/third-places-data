            "review_text": "Pinevilel Library, I've been coming to this library for a little over a month, I usually book a study room so I can focus and not have any distractions. I've never had an issue and I love the facility...However, all of a sudden, in the past two days, 2 employees have  walked in my room and turned the lights all the way up. I know this doesn't sound like a big problem but I have sensory issues and all my work is on a computer and bright lights are very distracting and cause glare on my screen also gives me a migraine very quickly which is hence why I even book a private room. I have not found a on paper rule saying that it's an actual policy to have the lights at a certian brightness. A staff member in fact only said it's a \"preference\" for them. I even said okay and left the lights on a very dim setting and they still come right in and turn them up. I'm really about to stop coming to this library because like I said I come to focus and I really can't work with the lights on. The doors are all glass and so much light already comes in and they can see me just fine. Again I know it sounds like a small thing but for someone who is quiet sensitive to light and has to stare at a computer screen as is, it literally leads me to sensory overload which makes it hard to focus, and my eyes want to go straight to the lights, also causing migraines which eventually leads to physically feeling sick and all this stemming from just a bright light that I truly don't understand why it's an issue.\n\nI really did like this library, but it shouldn't be a big deal for those who have private study areas to leave the lights off or very low. Especially considering everyone is different and could have different conditions that within reason should be easily accommodated. I'm autistic and also have an eye condition that causes me to percieve light differently (kind of brighter and more scattered) also making me more sensitive. And the staff didn't ask if there's a reason or anything they just walk in and say \"I'm turning this up okay bye.\"\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, I really liked this library but I'm starting to get frustrated."

They shall be a great asset to the team. The decor was color-coded by section. I believe Blue is for children and Green was is Teen section. The floor and the ceiling pattern have history coordination as well. Also, the welcome brochure matches the color codes of the library which is genius \nThey will have writing programs, rental opportunities(remember, it's a PUBLIC library so anyone can venture into your section)\nVending\nMeeting room\nKitchen\nEtc.\nI could say more, but you just need to check it out!"
