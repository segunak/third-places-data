I cannot overstate how committed this company is to its customers and its community. The outstanding product is just the cherry on top. Tony and team have made lifetime customers out of us (and any friend of mine who will listen).\n\n----original review below----\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been ordering coffee from Enderly Coffee Company for almost a year. Our espresso machine has held nothing but Enderly beans since we moved to Charlotte, and we are slowly making our way through every kind of bean they offer for our daily coffee. Their Friday home delivery is such an excellent service--every time I run low on beans, I just hop on and pick a new bag to be dropped off at my doorstep for free that Friday--and every time we've been in the shop we are just so pleased by the kindness of those behind the counter. Tony Santoro has personally helped me skip subscription orders if I'm not going through beans as fast and he even helped me exchange a shirt I bought without even having to come in the shop. There are always new treats from local places popping up for Friday delivery and we love checking them out. I'm just so happy a place like this exists in my community and I'm excited to continue to drink Enderly Coffee for years to come."

            "review_text": "The chai tea latte at Enderly is so good that I automatically go for the largest cup. And, honestly, that's still not enough. I don't know if I'm a hopeless romantic or just plain delusional but I like to pretend that the barista makes my drinks especially for me. \n\nService is great and I appreciate the staff's willingness to help customers with questions about the menu. I know this from eavesdropping, though, because, me? I'm always sure of what I want. I'm boring - but the drinks here aren't.\n\nEnderly Coffee Co. is quite vibey. It's full of art and locally made merch such as stone mugs and the like. It's perfect for catching up with friends, a coffee date, or for studying. It can't really accommodate big groups so plan accordingly.\n\nParking is available behind the building but please note that the lot is small. It's definitely a community gem in an area that is rapidly being gentrified. Somehow, Enderly still feels very Charlotte despite all that's changing in the neighborhood.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!"

Location is weird too as it is right on a very busy street with several mechanic/car mod businesses across the street and if you're sitting outside, forget having a conversation because every couple of minutes a car/motorcycle/four-wheeler takes off with full acceleration and modified exhausts that blast your eardrums. The particular staff member we encountered was not rude, per se, but definitely seemed a bit annoyed about something and was curt in his responses. I had an iced vanilla latte with oat milk and my friend had an Americano, which I had no complaints about. Don't expect much in the way of eats. The croissant was good enough and the chocolate cookie was ok, but there were literally one of each left and nothing else (we arrived an hour before closing time). Overall, I would probably not go back because there are much closer places to home with better hours and same, if not better, quality coffee."

Coming here I was very impressed by the coffee and now feel kind of sad I won't be able to try them again.  This is definitely a pretty impressive new shop and better than most any roaster I have had in Nashville.  I am from the Pacific Northwest, lived in Denver and have ordered coffees from around the country, including from California, Missouri, Illinois and New York.  I have had an appreciation for some of the best roasters in the country and I will say this stuff impressed me.  If they end up shipping and nitrogen packing their bags I may consider ordering some of this stuff.   Also, they charge very little for the quality of the coffee.   I think some of the snobby shops in Seattle could learn a thing or two about high quality and modest pricing like this shop has.   Definitely a very good micro-roaster.  I would put them and Hex at the top of roasters I have had in Charlotte."

And a place where the barista made the effort right away to know my name, ask a few questions about who I am and where I live, and get me set up for that dark elixir of life that keeps me from hatin' on people when they don't use their noggins.\n\nGood folks, good products, good prices.

The vibe and ambiance is everything we would want to have in a local coffee shop.  Tacoby was our barista and we enjoyed the drinks as well as the conversation.  We were able to setup office for a few hours and get things done.  We wish we had Enderly out in Cornelius, NC!  We will be back whenever on that end of Charlotte."

I can feel good knowing my money is going to a people who are \"for people\", creating jobs and for the coffee bean farmer, loving people well, and roasting and brewing a perfect cup to ignite your day! The cinnamon rolls they serve on Saturdays look divine - that's on my list this coming Saturday! Great new place to grab a cup of coffee!"
