The modern interior with wooden elements and spacious layout gave off a cozy vibe right off the bat.\n\nWe ordered a matcha latte, chai latte, and an almond croissant. The lattes were pretty milk-heavy, so the matcha and chai flavors didn't really come through. The almond croissant was generous enough to tide us over, though.\n\nIt was a quick visit, but I could see this place being great for chilling out or getting some work done. Solid spot overall!"

Never says a word and acts like I'm giving him the biggest inconvenience when all I do is try to order. I usually try to brush it off but I couldn't the other day after I was treated so rudely for being behind on picking up my to go order.  When I asked what was wrong he just scoffed and rolled his eyes at me. It is truly hurtful and such an unpleasant experience. Im not sure if it is bc of my skin color bc when I asked another person and see him interacting with others, it is never the same energy I get. It is really unfortunate bc I do like this shop and most of the other workers are amazing especially Kat!

If you're in the area I'd highly recommend a visit.\n\nI'd say their avocado toast is the best in town - definitely try it with the sundried tomatoes and onion.  The granola parfait is great as well.\n\nThe baristas are friendly and actually know how to make coffee and espresso beverages.  Service is generally quick.  The atmosphere is really nice, especially on a day with good weather - they will open the big garage doors to open our onto the patio.\n\nThey have free wifi and plenty of seating so this is a great place to work for an afternoon or collaborate with colleagues.\n\nIt's also a great placefor hosting a small event.  Because this is mine and my husband's regular coffee place, we decided to host an informal brunch the day after our wedding here.  They were super accommodating and made sure we have everything we needed.  It was very reasonably priced for renting a part of their space.  We brought in outside catering and served NJC coffee."

Came in hoping for their newly advertised breakfast sandwich but apparently it's only offered during the week. Would have been nice if that was stated somewhere on their web site or IG. So we opted for the breakfast biscuit sandwich and toast with a poached egg. The sandwich was terrible. No better than a egg McMuffin sandwich with a pre-prepared egg puck like you get at McDonald's. The poached egg on the toast was over cooked.  Service was also kind of meh. I'll just stick to the coffee from now on."

The open space keeps you from feeling bunched up against others and this is nice. There is a ton of seating both inside and out.\n\nThere aren't any \"nooks\" or corners where you can have a bit of privacy. This may not matter to some but I like it in a coffee shop; it's a bonus of sorts.\nThere is also a bar that allows dogs across the street so you can sit outside and watch dogs at times and I love this."

It's called Not Just Coffee but after 2pm it is Just Coffee, and of course the other expected coffee shop fare like tea and muffins. So if you want anything that isn't \"just coffee\" and it's the afternoon then your hopes are dashed.\nBut I didn't care too much and just ordered a latte. It was over 6 dollars after tax if I'm not mistaken. But the price wasn't that important to me as I assumed it would be a large (which I said in my order \"a large latte\")\nWell it was super tiny. The cup went in my hand and reminded me of that shot of Andre the giant holding a beer can. Except he was a giant and I'm 5 feet 8 inches tall.\nI asked \"is this a large?\" And he responded in a rather annoyed tone \"it is all one size\" which wasn't explained when i ordered a large size. Also for the price it is incredibly miniscule.\nOn top of this I was \"dining inside\" and I was given a disposable cup. Why are they giving tiny paper cups rather than mugs. I looked around and every person had a paper cup inside.\nThe latte was nothing special either. I hate Starbucks and I'd 100% rather go there than to this place ever again."
