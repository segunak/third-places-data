Wish it was a regular fried egg instead of the one received. And a bacon that did not remind me of precooked bacon - maybe a thicker cut too - would have made it better.\nIced mocha was good once it cooled down - first few sips were room temp because it seemed the hot coffee was put in the cup first instead of ice first - took a bit to finally cool down.\nI can appreciate the made from scratch pastries and I do understand the costs of running a small business. However to spend $32 for two drinks and two bacon, egg, cheese sandwiches seemed a little pricey.\nWill return just not as often due to cost."

I love the play on the name Sunflour: indicating everything is baked in house. The fact that they had lots of Vegan options for me and even more options for my family was amazing. I of course got the Lavender 5 shots Latte with Oat Milk and it was probably one of the best cups I've ever had. You could actually smell the lavender. The foam was perfect and the cup was just delightful delicious. I also bought 4 cupcakes ( 2 red velvet, 1 lemon & 1 pistachio) they didn't even make it home the kids ate them up. I was told they were finger licking good. I also purchased 2 vegan scones, 1 cheddar & chive biscuits & 1 cinnamon roll. I think I paid $40 for 8 bakery items & 2 lattes. So the price was great  this spot is a must if you love fresh food made with love and good ingredients."

The blueberry is delicious, but I love the Snickerdoodle muffin! They also make excellent coffee. I usually get the iced caramel latte. Sunflour has a decent amount of seating inside. There is also a patio for the warmer months. Please go check it out!"

When you enter the restaurant is filled with natural light.  It feels warm and inviting.  The pastry case is the focal point straight ahead.  To your left is a coffee bar and to the right is the dining area.  The dining area is rather small so it would not be a place for large groups or people who are very loud.  The dining area was very clean and neat.\n\n2.  They had really good customer service.  Everyone was kind and patient as we ordered.  They also bring your food out to your table when its done.  Our only complaint was the wait time.  It took a really long time to receive our sandwiches.  It was about 15 minutes.  The kitchen was a bit busy but it only appeared to be about 2 other orders ahead of us.\n\n3.  The food was bland.  We ordered an egg provolone, and spinach croissant, turkey and cranberry club, pecan sticky bun, a chocolate croissant, and a caramel katte along with 2 orange juices.  Our order was about $45 (which we felt was reasonable).  While all of our food was ok, it was nothing memorable about it. We wanted to really love the pastries but we just didn't.\n\n4.  You should try this location if you're in the area.  You'll get good service and decent food.  However, I would not make a special trip to dine here."

The egg is sous vide and soft melting in your mouth (a touch of maldon salt flakes would elevate but that's personal preference). Desserts are to be cheered and not devoured like a hypoglycemic clinging for a sugar fix but more of a prized possession savoring every bite. What I love about this place is it reminds me of  foreign bakeries as I travel the world regularly for work. I'm sincerely surprised by the fact it isn't 5 stars but understand the commercial, consumerist and rushed American buyer my not fully understand the purpose of this establishment. I will be back and bringing friends."

When communicating with Lauren she was punctual and informative, the sample presentation was also incredible - after seeing what they were able to put together as the to-go sample order, we knew they were the perfect fit for our wedding. Lauren really listened to what we were looking for (mini winter themed desserts) and delivered perfectly. The wedding cake itself was also exactly what we were looking for, she worked off inspiration pictures and it was beautiful. We can't pick a favorite from all of the desserts they provided, they were all so tasty. We cannot recommend Sunflour enough and are so looking forward to getting more baked goods from you guys in the future. Thank you!! - Emily & Andy"

I am a HUGE fan of the food and drinks (see below), but there are some hiccups that others also have identified that can be frustrating.\n\nFirst off, the food: fantastic (and I mean fantastic!) pastries, croissants, muffins, sandwiches and the like. I have never, ever been disappointed. I have had breakfast and lunch there on multiple occasions. I stop by occasionally for afternoon tea. I once even made a large catering order for the hospital where I work. Surprisingly, not a lot of people at work had heard of this place, but the food (sandwiches, salads and drinks) were universally loved and I know, for sure, that that catered lunch led to a number of new enthusiastic SBC customers.\n\nFor caffeine enthusiasts, their roasts are high-quality and they have a diverse offering of coffees (all from local CLT-area companies) and teas. The tea, Rishi, is quality, but overpriced at more than $4/cup.\n\nI genuinely appreciate that they emphasize their local roots, highlighting local ingredients and promoting other local companies in their products. Hooray for the small guys! The staff are always friendly and as helpful as possible.\n\nThe one see where I think SBC can improve is efficiency and communication. When I tried catering, I had to call due to a problem with my online order. The person on the phone, located at the Ballantyne location, had no idea how to solve my problem and said, \"sorry, we get no training for online orders.\" I ended up paying more than I was supposed to. Similarly, in the store, i occasionally have long waits for items. More recently, I stopped by for afternoon tea. After 15 minutes of waiting, I went back up to the counter and the woman there sincerely apologized, saying, \"I'm so sorry, I thought the other person had made it already.\"\n\nDespite these hiccups, which are human errors and mild in the grand scheme of things, I genuinely love SBC. I have brought many friends here, all of whom also have loved their products. I would highly recommend any time!"

I have been to all of there locations in the Charlotte & surrounding area. This one continues to have problems. Their pastries are about the only thing that stay consistent. Their #2 is currently a pregnancy craving of mine, I add the basil/walnut pesto with avocado. I have been given the sandwich missing an egg, with an ice cold egg and no cheese, with the tomato pesto instead (which is not good IMO), missing the avocado, etc. It boggles my mind how EVERY SINGLE TIME something is wrong with the sandwich. Ive ordered online, over the phone, and in person. It doesnt matter, wrong everytime. This is the closest location to me and it's still 30 minutes away. I wont be going here anymore sadly and will just have to make the drive to the other locations. The staff seem like they mean well but goodness, someone has got to whip things into shape."

We have to go out of way to come to this store - it is not nearby. After numerous issues, we will just stop patronizing this business.\n\nAlso there is supposed to be a mask policy in this store which is clearly indicated by the sign on the front door. We  were wearing our masks when not eating and social distancing from others in the shop, the employee at the register had her mask down under her chin."

The wait time for sandwiches can be particularly long, especially at lunch.\n2. I've been told 10 minutes after I place an order (and pay for it) that a certain ingredient/sandwich is out of stock. This specific scenario has happened more than once. I get it that everyone is having supply chain issues right now, but you could let me know before the order is rung up.\n3. It really stinks when I open my sandwich at home and see that one or two ingredients on my non-customized order were forgotten. :( This happens not infrequently."

Several years ago my wife and I tried their croissants and at the time we decided these are the greatest croissants we'd EVER eaten... ANYWHERE!  Since then we pretty much try croissants at every bakery we can find to see if there is an equal or better croissant.  We're happy to announce that after 5 years of trying, Sunflour Bakery is STILL the number one croissant we've ever eaten.  There are only two other runner-ups at a place called Mocco Bistro and a place called Crema, both in Charlotte.  Interestingly, many of the other things we try at Sunflour are only meh and almost EVERYTHING we have at Crema is perfect so bear that in mind.  As for croissants Sunflour is the BEST"

Not only are they severely understaffed, but they are very unprepared for their customer volume. We placed an order on Saturday morning via their mobile app, and we waiting for our time to get our food.  Good thing we walked in and checked in on the order because they had cancelled our order without even telling us bc they ran out of eggs!!! How is that even possible? Prepare better.\n\nSecondly, when I was giving the young girl a bit of customer feedback on having a better system of letting customers know if their orders had been cancelled (we received no notification whatsoever) - she was EXTREMELY unprofessional rude, and passive aggressive. At that point, I was stunned how she had spoken to me. Not only did she blame ME, the customer, but she couldn't just do the right thing in a customer service role and apologize for the delay and poor service. She copped an attitude and became very passive aggressive.\n\nSo, not only are they losing our business, but I am writing this google review to allow others to have a piece of helpful info before ordering from them.\n\nSunflour Baking Company - choose your employees carefully and wisely. If you do not instruct them on the proper ways to diffuse situations with customers, then they should not be dealing with them. If you teach them and they still do not adhere, then they should not be employed. It's as simple as that. I have over 15+ years in customer service and today I was completely and utterly amazed at how this girl spoke to me."

First the person that was one the phone had no idea what the flavors were that were available. I will note I  will take ownership that I did not ask how Much the order would be, but the price was not discussed. I figured it would more expensive than traditional cupcakes but goodness 20 cups were $87!! $3.50 per cupcake. A vanilla and/ or chocolate cupcake with pink frosting, nothing fancy!! If I had known I would have ordered 2 for the mom and then gone to Publix and gotten the other 18 for the same price as the 2? I don't get it. My husband said \" put the gluten back in for that price\" also it's not like they were any bigger than a food lion/ Harris teeter cupcake. This was my first time getting anything here, so not impressed. Not to mention they were running so far behind I had to wait in line just to pick up the preordered cupcakes. The person on the register had no idea what she was doing and they were running out of things for other people who were waiting. So many people waiting on food. Again my first impression was NOPE!!"

They rarely open on time, which is annoying when you're trying to stop there before work.  Sometimes they open up to 30 minutes late.  Also, their muffins are almost always undercooked and gooey inside (completely raw at times), which is a health hazard.  Every single time I've ordered the Morning Glory muffin it's been raw inside, which is sad because it's my favorite.  If they could fix these two things, I'd be there all the time."

I will have to return to try breakfast or lunch and a coffee selection.\n\nOne negative (which I don't believe is viable to change) is while eating we saw the restaurant across the way pulling catering pans from a van and just hosing them down and leaving on the ground beside the restaurants trash cans.  Just not a scene you want to view while eating: trash bags and cans and pans being rinsed with hose."

I called, Stacey told me they had a $20 gift card waiting for me and apologized. I let it go and appreciated the customer service. About a week later I go to pick up my gift card. It was VERY busy, lots of \"mature\" aged people being very particular about things and asking loads of questions. I only get a 30 minute lunch break so I was in a rush to pick up the gift card then leave to pick up my lunch from somewhere else. I waited 15 min just to talk to the new girl at the register to get my card...she filled it out and I rushed out. An hour later I'm at work and pull it out of my purse and realize it's only for $10. So they messed that up to so my gift card didn't even cover the cost of the meal they screwed up. I haven't bothered to call again to rectify it. Again I will say the food is yummy but just so many screw ups lately makes me not want to go back when I usually go at least twice a week."

They had to read the package it came in, to let us know it was a boars Head honey ham. Asked for the a different sandwich on a cheddar biscuit. They say they are out of cheddar biscuits.
