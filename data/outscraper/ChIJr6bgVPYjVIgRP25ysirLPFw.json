Also the French Onion Soup I would not order again as it was just some broth with a few croutons to be put into it.  There really was no cheese except maybe a hint when you stirred it.  The French Onion soup I have eaten in the past was smothered with melted cheese on the top.  They really should not call this French Onion Soup.  It is broth with onions and throw a few croutons in.  It will be quite sometime before I order, if I do, from Panera's again."

Overpriced soup and sandwich place with fraction of a sandwich. Won't be doing this very often. Now I remember why it's been so long since we've been here last.

All while smiling a big smile that you could see underneath her mask!!  I went inside and placed my order- I watched as Anna continued to work just as fast as she could- still polite and still smiling- I then received my food, a Chipotle Chicken Avacodo sandwich which a was phenomenal!! I had never had one that wasn't super dry until this day!! It was delicious!! I have to say that this is  HANDS DOWN THE BEST PANERA IN A 30 MILE RADIUS!! I will be back and all of you should give them a try as well!! I promise you will not be disappointed!! Again- Thanks Anna for being who you are!! :)"

We get delivery all the time so we are quick and prompt with answering the door. The driver argued with me, had an attitude, when I told him it didn't arrive. I even checked others doors to see if it was at the wrong door. I didn't see it. I asked for a refund and he still got snarky about the refund. I had to ask for a confirmation on cancelation cause I didn't trust him. He ended up putting someone else on the phone to handle his mistake."

The most professional, friendly employees helped me place an order (it's been a couple of years since I've eaten at a Panera Bread!), plus recover my old Panera account. The cream cheese I got was fresh and cold, the bagels were delicious, altho a bit dry because they were bought at the end of the day. They were redeemed when toasted and spread with butter and  cream cheese. Yum. Highly recommend this place. The surrounding area is quaint, as well."
