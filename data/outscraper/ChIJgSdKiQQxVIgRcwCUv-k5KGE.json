Every ingredient tasted so fresh.\n- yes, I know I ordered a lot but I also ordered the pasta salad and JEZZ was it good. Once again everything tasted so fresh.\n\nOnce I was done eating I walked in the back where they have the cutest gift shop and bakery.  \n\nThis place is an inspiration to any person wanting to open local business.

Very happy that they have a couple gluten free food & dessert options (would love to see more gluten free savory items pls). The atmosphere/decorations are great, and gift shop is fun to explore.\n\nEverything is quite good, but we especially like their beef pot pie, pea salad, & lavender macarons. Highly recommend their peaches & cream tea, with steamed milk.\n\nCons: The wait times are long, so prepare to wait 30-45mins on a Saturday. I wish they were open past 5pm during the week."

Since we had driven 50 minutes for the experience, we decided to wait. The boutique was charming and well-decorated, which helped pass the time.\n\nWhen we finally got a table, we ordered the baked Brie we'd been looking forward to, only to be told they were out (at 2 PM on a Saturday). Disappointing. We ended up with the kids' ham & cheese sandwich, avocado toast with poached egg, broccoli cheddar soup, and savory biscuits. The food was okay but not remarkable.\n\nFor tea and desserts, the experience fell apart. The server left our meal dishes on the table, forcing us to stack tea and desserts on top of them. I eventually had to move the dishes to a nearby table myself because who likes the smell of broccoli cheddar soup when you eat a brownie ?!\nThe teapot leaked boiling water as it was placed on the table, and the hot chocolate for our toddler arrived fridge-cold. When we asked for it to be warmed, the server initially refused, then reluctantly brought back a boiling, water-based version without warning us of how hot it was, resulting in our toddler burning his tongue, which is still sore 24 hours later!!!\n\nThe macaron was dry and too cold, the brownie was also dry, but the pecan bar was decent.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing experience, and we won't return."

It has everything you could want in a Tea Room from flaky Scones to little sandwiches and a plethora of other yummy options such as Chicken Pot Pie, Quiche and a Picnic Basket of different kinds of scone sandwiches. I loved the gooey baked brie cheese with flaky crust and blueberry scone I had. The truffle was like a reeses cup only much better - sweet and smooth. Good atmosphere too! Unfortunately the service was a bit slow, but we will definitely come back, it was a busy day for them."

The house, the vintage China, using vintage handkerchiefs as napkins. The food and desserts were really good. The chicken pot pie was amazing. I had 2 teas, iced chai and a cup of hot earl gray, both very good.The staff was really friendly. The chocolate cake and the lemon tart were both delicious. They were quick to response and replaced the piece of cake I had, since there were egg shells in the cake. We will definitely be back since we already know what we are going to order. The only thing is that I  wished the staff came to the table to take our orders. The room where you have to go to order your food is very small  and when you exit the room you go right into a dining room and when it is crowded it hard to maneuver around. Also, it is better to order and dessert all at one time."

They have menu items that complement every taste. The pricing was surprisingly wonderful for the quality and pleasing table placement. This place pays attention to details that completely the entire visit.\nOur service staff were excellent and the cashier was patient, polite and very helpful.\nWe ventured into the gift shop before leaving and was instantly impressed with the vintage items as well as the beautiful tea gifts.\nI strongly suggest that if you love intimate cozy places with rich nostalgia you must visit this place."

Ordered cold Last Mango in Paris tea and it was phenomenal. Wish the biscuit came out hot, but otherwise it was good especially the sweet potato biscuit. Chicken on Holiday is a must try but if given choice it would be nice to pair with some crackers or toasted bruschetta. I would like to see them incorporate mango in their desserts especially they're in the season. Definitely recommend this place. Came at 9:30am and ate on the porch and was perfect weather. By time we finish which was 11:30am, the place was packed. A nice gem in the heart of Monroe."

Standing in line (for quite a while) while dodging the wait staff who are using the same hallway for food delivery and dodging people trying to get in and out of the bathrooms being blocked by the line (while in a cramped space with loud music) is just not the relaxing vibe you want with your tea.\n\nProblems with menu/inventory: I ordered the baked brie, but they didn't have it. I tried for the chicken pie, but they didn't have it. Finally ordered soup when I was given the 3 options of what they did still have. Not what I wanted, but it was okay. (We were there hours before closing, so that wasn't the problem.)\n\nAlso, a lot of small problems...no spoons given with soup, scone was freakishly dry (but still good flavor), wasp's nest on porch, etc. My husband and I had to *share a spoon* because no one could/would track another one down for us.\n\nThe tea was good and the atmosphere was cute, so I would give them another try...maybe it was just an off day."

Enjoying a cup of tea here is a delightful experience every time. Their only weak point is the food. The food looks great and is presented well, but lacks quality, flavor and consistency. Also, whatever you do, do not order the hot cocoa in the colder months, it tastes like low quality store brand hot cocoa mixed with too much hot water and too little cocoa. But, please do visit this establishment and enjoy a cup of tea and browse the gift shop. It really is a lovely experience!"

            "review_text": "Very disappointed. This is a far cry from a traditional afternoon tea experience.\n\nFrom the onset, we were confused about the ordering process as we expected to be seated & to have a server come to take our order in the usual order. However, we were ushered down a narrow hallway to a delicatessen-styled room where we were handed menus & instructed to place our orders with the clerk. After doing so, and paying, we were handed a table number card and instructed to wander about and find an available table. We were starting to feel as though we were in an overly decorated-Starbucks and not tea establishment at all.\nOnce we found an available table, it took some time for our food to arrive. Our scones & pots arrived first and we asked our waiter for the steeping time & a saucer to remove & dispose the tea bags. He looked at us completely confused but did wander off to find a saucer, but was baffled over our initial question.\nNext we received the sandwiches which were an overall disappointment. They were nothing special and very bland.\nThe scones were massive but were hard, dry, and crunchy! Crunchy scones! They did come with an assortment of condiments: Whipped cream, lemon curd, whipped butter, and jam, but only a teaspoon of each was offered for such a massive scone, and there certainly was not enough platted for two people to share. By the way, real Clotted Cream, or Devonshire cream is not available, instead, we were provided with a thin, watery whipped cream that quickly melted into a puddle\nLastly, we sampled the pea salad, which again was terrible. This reminded me of the seven layer salad that my mother used to make long ago at family gatherings.\nOn a positive note, I will say that the establishment is beautifully decorated, and I adored the theme of English meets Orient. The decor, wallpaper, and furnishings were artfully chosen and displayed; Its obvious a lot of attention and money went into the decor. I only wish they had just put as much effort into the food also.\nNot returning."

She had\nbought pre-packaged/wrapped cookies that said \"will you be my flower girl\" on them. A blonde server walked by us first with a look of disdain on her face as we waited in line to place our breakfast/tea order. She came back and asked us if we had cookies and told us we could not have \"outside food\" as if we had brought  a package of Oreos or McDonald's into the restaurant. We clearly planned to order food  there and the cookies were wrapped in a clear box as a parting gift for my children. Her tone was rude and unwelcoming so we left. I have worked in the food industry many years and while the lady may have thought she was doing her job, there could have been a kinder approach. It honestly just felt like she wanted to get rid of us as we had 7 people. It wasn't like we planned to sit and take up a whole table while we munched on our cookies. Also if you are going to be that peculiar, you might want to work on your 93 sanitation score. I do want to add that the gentleman/host up front was very kind but it went sour fast."

We got the $18 croissant that's filled with Brie, The croissant was delicious the cheese was way too much, the ratio was off and made it the inside for sure it needed more jam. Overall it's not something I would do often, especially without cramped it is when it's cold there's hardly any seating. Servers constantly walk past you while you're ordering in a really tight space very awkward. The staff was really nice but once they drop off food or tea not check on you as often as you think especially if it's busy. We did get refills couple times but nobody asked how the food was."

So friendly and attentive. The location is beautiful, in an old house and upstairs are multiple rooms to have more intimate tea experiences. Downstairs is more open. I can't recommend this place enough, and believe me I will be back again and again and again!"

Nor was I told that there was bacon in a salad. They fixed it right away. I just wish communication would've been correct when I ordered. Then I went back the second day to pick up a bunch of treats for my daughter's birthday. I took them home and gave them to her later. One of the treats was very bad.  I then had to drive it back to get her some thing she could enjoy. We definitely will return because I love the atmosphere, the food options and the cause behind this small business.

It is a way from the contemporary hustle and bustle and technical maze in which we navigate. Whether having a spot of tea with a decadent scone or hosting a tea, or lunch with a friend,  be prepared to be transformed,  treated with tenderness and teased by desserts, entrees  that please and perform and are simply, works of art. Your napkins are cotton handkerchiefs that compliment table cloths. While, not required, appropriate apparel sets the tone for a wonderful experience, maybe even a fascinator and gloves if you like. Supports a good cause. I will be a regular. Thank you for gracing us with your gifts, which in turn empower women and children to live and lead independent, self-sufficient lives, serving others."

We ordered way too much food because everything sounded so good.  None of it disappointed. The mismatched china and crystal serving pieces were SO FUN!  What a treat.  It already seems very popular, so be prepared to wait awhile to order at the register.  Can't wait to go back!"

The design of their cafe is very unique and you won't find it anywhere else.\n\nTeas selection is huge. And the food is very tasty.Moreover, the service is impeccable .\nThere were misunderstanding at the cashier when I was placing my order. So they brought me a different tea not the one I ordered, however, a super nice woman left this tea and brought me my initial order.But not just that she brought me 2 more cups of  Tea to choose from so I ended up having three different kind of teas !!!! I love all of them and of course I was very impressed by the hospitality and the service.\n\nI definitely will be a regular. I love this place uniqueness. I love the food and the service , so you definitely want to check it out and I'm sure you're gonna love it to"
