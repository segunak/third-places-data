I got pizza and my wife got cannolis both were heavily overpriced and the portions were very small. The pizza was so salty I couldn't even finish the tiny pizza I had ordered. I will never go here again nor would I recommend this place to anyone. Between the parking the food and drinks with our meal I spent almost $90 and we left in 30 minutes very disappointed."

Today, I ventured further down the corridor to try a delicious Rose from the Assorted Wine spot, got Momos, and a soft and scrumptious waffle. I usually get my NC catfish fix with Jimmy's and a smoothy. Either way, I feel like I won! Bring a friend, a date orb the family, and see what 7th Street Station is all about!"

It's always a nice time when I go. We came on a Sunday, and they were surprisingly empty. Just went for a drink. Most of the restaurant shops there were closed so maybe that's why they were empty. None the less, it's def. A must try place. They do have a parking deck right beside the building, and they validate parking, which is a plus. They have clean restrooms, and all employees are super polite. Whenever I'm in the area, this is a place always on my list."

This is a place you'll need to visit a few times in order to taste every restaurant.\nI order from Mad Dash the Mad Dash Angus Burger w/ lettuce, tomato,  cheese, friend egg, & aioli sauce. It was really good however my top bioche bun was toasted a little too long so it wasn't soft. Order the onion rings which were so good I didn't need ketchup. The 8 lemon peppered wings with their homemade ranch was really good too. They were different & better from the wings you'd get at a Buffalo Wild Wings or East Coast Wings.\nJimmy Pearl's Sorrel Punch is tasty. The shrimp, greens, fried fish & fish sandwich are good too! Staff is friendly.\nHip Hop Smoothie is different from what I've seen before and I was pleasantly surprised. The owner is friendly and helped me figure out what I might like since I'm not a smoothie drinker.\nThis was my second visit.. the first visit I was in food heaven & order from about 4 places.  However, I've got to go back a few more times so I can try EV-ER-Y-THING!  There are tables in the center of the floor for seating & some seating in front of the actual food spots. Oh, located next to ImaginOn, the rail & 7th street parking garage. Any of the businesses can validate your parking ticket which covers the first hour & a half."
