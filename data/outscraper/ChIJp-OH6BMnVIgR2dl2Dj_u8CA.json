I'm at home because I'm sick which is the only reason I ordered soup from here because it's usually really good. I've worked in restaurants for over 13 years so knowing that the employees didn't double check the food order to make sure it was correct is not okay. I get it was later in the night but that's not reason to not take time and ensure customers are getting what they paid for. Probably won't eat from here again after this."

First of all, the cashier could not figure out how to bill \"you pick 2\" and applied all items separately, then at pick up I was given my order as \"to go\", while I chose to dining in. When I reminded about that, I was explained that they don't serve meals at evening since it was too late to wash dishes! The last thing blown my mind, they started vacuuming close to where I was eating. Once, I politely asked to finish vacuuming after I leave, the cashier complained, but another personal come and continued vacuuming, saying that her manager allowed her to do that. I was very offended by such behaviour. I went to the manager to ask what was going on. He made the employee to stop vacuuming. However, the employee said loud offensive words towards me. It is unacceptable! I would recommend avoiding this location. Management, please take an action until you lose all the customers or someone sue you!"

I always put NO UTENSILS on my take out orders and yet I ALWAYS find utensils in my bag. Sometimes you don't even get baguettes or any sides with the order because they'd run out. Other times they run out of an ingredient for some dishes. The tea sometimes taste old like it's been refrigerated too long and lost its fresh tea taste or a bit watered do at times. again I have a year's worth of experience eating from here. It's good sometimes but lacks consistency. 2 stars because I like Panera in general."

And I have tried you again only to be disappointed even further my chips were not in my bag with my U-Pick2. Employees outside in front of the door smoking cigarettes very unprofessional customer service when I went in to get my chips the young girl behind the pickup Cafe had a horrible attitude and  threw  the chips on the counter. I did go back into speak with a manager. Young people if you're working in customer service please remember that customer service is the number one thing that you're supposed to have is excellent customer service enjoy helping others and serving others or get a new job. She also threw the top to my drink and instead of them having any small cups one of the guys handed me a coffee cup to fix my drink because he said they ran out of small cups so when I had to come back  to get a top the same rude little girl through the top on the counter thank God I'm saved Lord knows it's very sad how y'all young folk act today it's very sad and all I can do is say help your parents cuz I can only imagine what they go through someone so disrespectful on the job I can only imagine what you're like at home thank God you're not my child is all I can say today. I definitely will not be coming back to this location ever again."

Again I was told that the web orders are started as received. I replied that I did not care about the internal processes and that I can reheat the food after i drove 15 minutes to my destination. I was there at 8;40 PM. I got an apology and an offer to remake anything that was not hot. Thats when I left. I am not going to unpack my order and taste test everything to make sure it was hot.

Then they realize that my order must've been given or picked up by the wrong person because the cook had just made it. While I was waiting for them to make the new order they came out and brought me some free pastries to take home and said sorry for the confusion & wait. I appreciated that very much. A lot of places don't do things like that to compensate anymore. It meant a lot to me and made the experience a positive one. The flat bread tasted wonderful. It's priced very fairly too as it was more than enough for two meals. Thank you Panera! I will gladly return to the Arboretum location!"

I ordered a pick 2 meal, and only got the cup of soup, my sandwich and side item were completely missing. When I realized this upon returning  home, I called to complain to the manager. He was unable to give me a refund over the phone since I paid in cash, so I was given the option to have a few Pick 2 coupons mailed to my house to make up for the missing items in my last meal. It's been almost 4 weeks and I've yet to receive a coupon. This is not the first time I've had food missing or gotten the wrong order completely.  It's very frustrating to continually have sloppy employees and even more frustrating to be promised compensation and never get it. I work in the same shopping center, but now I go out of my way to order from other locations. This one is always disappointing."

The way employees greet the customer I believe is very important and help businesses to bring the customer back.\nThis employee of Panera Bread gives you the smile and warm welcome on every visit, and ensure that you are happy with the order.\n\nUnfortunately too many people are working as store managers, but how many of these people know the importance of customer service, and reward their employees."

I lower rating is because they deliver toasted bagels to your table now...toasted things are usually only good while they are hot...my usual carbonation experience relishes the hot butter melting on a cinnamon crunch bagel.  I used to get it right at the counter but now it gets toasted, sits a bit, so it loses both the toastedness and warmth of the bagel until it is delivered.  I would be more satisfied waiting the 39 seconds to have it toasted at the counter.  I know I could get up and stand in line again and get another one but alas, I figure this will make a longer process change."

It took me calling NINE times to even get anyone to pick up the phone and the resolution was come get my sandwich and a gift card for another sandwich. The manager barely apologized and didn't even offer to deliver the order even though Panera has delivery. When my husband picked up the order the manager refused to speak with him and gave us no gift card. His employees shared that he also treats them poorly - shocking! His excuse by phone was they were busy, but I called from 2:15 - 2:35 without anyone picking up and when my husband walked in the place was empty. Owners should be aware of who they are paying to run their investment."
