The new children's section is huge floorplan wise, but I think they need to add more interactive things for kids, as there were more way kids than things to play with. I'm hoping they bring back the play kitchen, some blocks or even add a pretend vehicle like ImaginOn has (decades ago books used to be viewed & delivered via a library truck to Derita before there was a library, that would be cool to homage). I saw there's a gated grass outdoor area in the back which would be perfect for a play / climbing structure as the weather gets better! Keeping my fingers crossed "

Most libraries when they get relocated, they have one floor with a new and modern look, but this one is a 2-story library. I'm still not happy with the city knocking down the old shopping center actually the building is done in the middle of the parking lot. but I can't do anything. Its now homes, library, and boardwalk.

The librarian proceeded to tell me I would not be able to check out any books because I did not have my license. She did not ask if I had any other means of proof of my address. She then proceeds to tell me my daughter can check out books at her school if she attends CMS. My daughter does not attend CMS but even if she did why would she be denied a free resource.\n\nI asked to escalate the situation and speak with someone else. The librarian spoke with her manager/supervisor separately. When she returned it was apparent that the manager thought the situation was as silly as I thought it was. She renewed my card and I was allowed to check out the books. Needless to say I will no longer go to this location. I typically go to the Huntersville and will revert to going to this location going forward. The librarians there are much more pleasant."

I only wish I would of gotten her name. She was about 5'5, slender, beautiful black lady. She answered all my questions and was so patient. Today, when I went back, I was using the computer lab and again was struggling with an issue. Today, the lady that   was working, when I went to her for assistance, she appeared to not want to help me. After explaining what the problem was three times, I asked her if maybe she could just come and look at it. She made EVERY excuse to not come help, but finally agreed to. When we got into the Computer Lab, she stood so far back from the computer she seriously could not see what I was talking about. Both of us were wearing mask, so I can't think it was a \"Covid \" concern. I  finally just gave up. It was not worth getting frustrated over. Too bad I didn't get her name either, but her name badge was flipped backwards. She was about 5'3, white, and maybe mid-30s."

We've been at this for 15 months now. The mask mandate has been lifted. If the vaccine works, why are you requiring people to wear masks?

The staff is friendly and it's easy to head out and buy a drink and lunch and return to finish studying or whatnot.
