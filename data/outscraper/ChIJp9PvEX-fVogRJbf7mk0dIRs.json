Their coffee shop is excellent and their food is a really well-planned menu that makes a strong addition to their offerings. I love that they have gf options since their beer is technically gf (less than 15 ppm- celiac delight!). This place just does a good job at everything. Yeah they get crowded, but it's for a reason."

The taco food truck outside complemented the drinks well.\n\nThey've seating both outside and inside as well as a rooftop. It's located right next to the train station.

Parking nearby can be a challenge--the garage right next to the brewery is free for the first 30 mins.\n\nOverall, it's a decent brewery in NoDa to have a fun time."

It was distinctive, cooked perfectly and came in an excellent delicious bun.  The garnish, while simple and straightforward, did not complicate the taste of the sandwich.  Any more would have ruined the balance. I was  trying to think of a better chicken sandwich I might have had before but couldn't think of one.  Their beer is great too.  My wife prefers hard seltzer to beer.  Hers was the best I've ever tried.  Bartender was friendly and cool.  And I love dogs, of which there were many hanging out.  This place is awesome and should be frequented regularly by those lucky enough to live close by."

Truth be told he comped me an extra because he said he liked me. That is true customer service right there, and that beer was my favorite, took one to go AND bought and awesome button down shirt for my hubby. Long story short , My experience with both locations was positive and for those that may have been apart of my experience will be happy to know that the 2X shirt ended up fitting!!!

We received buffalo wings instead of the sambal wings. I didn't really mind since it was very late but the wings itself were chewy. Dumplings were okay. We also couple of beers psychic dynamite (west coast ipa) beer and it was very good and another one called old world. I think this was a barrel aged ipa and it had a unique taste and I personally wasn't a fan of it."

I would suggest Keaton be fired for how he acted while on the clock at his job. Your place of business is not your own private brewey or a plave to be possive over your girl friend while you work when nobody was hitting on her.\n\nTrust me she wasnt our type....we sat in the public area and wanted to watch duke vs unc...needless to say i will happily give my money to other local brewries who appreciate professionalism and their customers.\n\nI am a busuness owner myself and i expect thing from my employees the same i do myself. So without hesitation.\n\nTreating my buisness like your own and doing as you please would have that employee  gagaga gone!!!\n\nI rekon the bar back feild can be hard to get into and find replacements for.\n\nGod Bless."

I was tempted to ask if they forgot the cheese, but then I saw a few specs holding the noodles together. C'mon you gotta have more cheese on a dish literally meant to have a lot of cheese. The fries were unfortunately bland despite looking really good. The nachos were good, but again needed more cheese and all the toppings were only on the top chips. Got half way through and it was just plain chips."
