It's mostly self serve which takes a lot if pressure off when trying a new place where there's a lot of options. However, the only negative thing wad the lady checking us out. She was very rude and didn't have good customer service skills. Didn't even greet us in and spoke to us very aggressively and bluntly when we were checking out. I normally don't make a review like this but since it was our first time there it just felt necessary. Will try a different location next time."

Green tea cloud cake and choco cloud cake were light, mouth watering and goes very well with latte. Raisin bread was fluffy, aromatic and has the right amount I of sweetness. Caramel cheesecake was little bit over sweet. Coming to coffee, Iced tiramisu latte, vanilla latte, lavender latte and cappuccino were outstanding."

Despite this, they offer a TON of baked goods. The staff were incredibly friendly as well. I got a honey castella, honeydew melon bread, taro loaf, honey mochi pancakes, and an iced red velvet latte. They were okay, a little stale but this may have been due to the fact that I ate them at home and not in the store. The red velvet latte was okay too, it didn't really taste like red velvet until I reached the pieces at the bottom of the cup. Overall, not bad but I just wish it was bigger and the seating wasn't so cramped. If I come here again, it will be for the honeydew melon bread "

There was no traffic and about 2 parking spaces to choose from. The shop itself is super cute and small. Upon entering, you are greeted with a variety of pastry and bread selections. The ladies at the counter were super nice and helpful. You get a tray in the beginning and your pair of tongs and start selecting any pieces you would like. I got the spinach and feta Danish, which I read tastes better warming up in the oven, which I'm so excited. I ended up wanting to purchase chocolate filled fluffy donut, which I'm so excited to try out! I also bought a vanilla latte, which was def. Needed for this cold weather. It was not too expensive as I thought it would be, and they were actually reasonably prices $3+. I did find out they have other locations, which I def do. Intend on visiting."

I can't even tell you what all they got but I got a piece of strawberry cake, a pumpkin something or other and one thing that looked like a sugar doughnut but was filled with cheese.

The doughnuts tasted fresh, the strawberry and creme pastry was *chefs kiss. My boyfriend also had the cookies and cream macaroons and he was annoyed  he only bought one haha! We demolished our pastries even though we wanted to save some for later they were THAT good. I also bought a cheesecake that I can't wait to have for dessert tonight :) my boyfriend had the strawberry smoothie and said it tasted fresh and not too sweet. The only thing I would say that was slightly disappointing was the butter pecan latte. It was lacking something I just can't put my finger on it. Overall we will DEFINITELY be back to try other items. Service was amazing as well. Thanks offline for having us!"

Another great addition to South End food portfolio.\nCompared to the other two locations in Charlotte, this one is more of a middle size - has some tables but not for large groups. I was told that the patisserie selection would be fairly similar to each other. I went here by noon so most of the patisseries were freshly baked and there were almost the full selection - not sure what it would look like closer to evening.\nMy favorite - the garlic cream cheese bread - was shaped differently with the flower-cut on the top. It tasted a bit sweeter compared to the one I bought from South Park location... but all good. Cute place to stop by for something light, or bring home for next day breakfast."
