The espresso is overextracted and violently bitter, while the filter coffee is weak, tasting more of commodity-grade coffee with unsweetened cherry flavor added to it. I have never had a good cup of coffee from Summit.\n\nI get it though, the vibes are nice, it's a good place to hang out or study or work, I suppose. But I can do that many other places and enjoy much better coffee while doing so.\n\nStaff is generally friendly enough, but baristas and hosts rarely have a deep knowledge or understanding of the roasts they are serving. Summit seems more like Starbucks for people who hate corporatism than a real specialty coffeeshop.\n\nSummit straddles the line between being that interesting-looking coffeeshop families who don't know any better go to as a treat, and being a cultural brand that also tries to make and serve its own coffee.\n\nAnd I think that's where the issue lies: Summit is more concerned about upholding and presenting its brand, culture, and image than upholding standards and presenting a beautiful cup of coffee.\n\nGo somewhere else, or if you absolutely have to go to Summit, get tea."

This location is  modern and have a more eclectic design but the same quality offering that Summit is known for. Staff is nice. Service is good. Love the outdoor seating and the live music. A great way to end Friday. Fall drinks are also now available. For non-pumpkin latte lover, try their Orange, spice and everything nice. Free WIFI."
