It is my immediate recommendation to anyone looking for a space to engage with board games, trading card games, miniatures games, TTRPGs, and more.\n\nThe store has an excellent selection of product at fair prices, including a generous rewards points system. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the products, and most employees are passionate enough about the products that they'll be the same people you see playing in the store. Dave, one of the owners, is extraordinarily friendly and present in the store, and goes above and beyond to accommodate different groups and individuals to ensure they have a welcoming, safe, and most of all fun experience.\n\nThe Mighty Meeple offers a community play space with a wide selection of games to demo at no cost. The play area is large compared to other stores, and it is always tidy and clean. They have sections dedicated to miniatures games as well so that there is no competing for play space. Their concession area is well-stocked with various snacks, baked goods, and beverages. If you drink, they also have a nice selection of beer and ciders on draught, as well as a selection of wine.\n\nThe store actively supports and fosters communities. They have been immensely supportive of our efforts to kickstart a Pauper Magic: the Gathering night, providing free prize support and sectioning off an area of the play space to reserve for our use. This is the case for many different games, not just Magic. Mighty Meeple has an event of some kind going on almost every day, so that those interested in meeting up with like-minded individuals have a space to do so. They put in the effort to maintain an impressive scheduling board in their play space so that you can be comfortable in knowing when different events of interest are happening. The Mighty Meeple is an important \"third place\" for many of its patrons and does a great job maintaining that role. I have met many of my close friends through events that Meeple has offered.\n\nThe Mighty Meeple is the gold standard for game stores, and I encourage you to check it out."

I asked about store credit on cards out of pack and he called them lightly played, whenever they were fresh from a pack, and near mint wasn't a category. I shouldn't be treated like some casual because I'm new to the shop. Most of the staff is very nice but there are 2 employees who are very rude. Every time I come here I have more negative things to say than positive, because of a few bad apples. 80% of the employees are awesome but it's the ones I run in to regularly that are very discriminatory and try to gouge the customer. I also play a certain family of magic and the clerk talked down about it and tried to tell me I was wasting my time when what I play is what I WANT TO PLAY!! Instead of putting down my interest and trying to short me on trade ins they should be boosting the community and embracing it. Honestly I will never be shopping here again after this."

The shop is nicely sized, well stocked, impeccably clean and bright, and the play space is awesome. The staff are approachable, knowledgeable, and helpful. As someone newer to MTG it has been really hard to find a welcoming and accessible shop to play at and meet new players. The Meeple team works hard to make people comfortable, help them improve their game, and help them meet new players. The staff pitch play nights and get excited when you show up- they even walked me around and introduced me to some regular players my first game night to help me find a pod and get started. They also have a LOT of inventory. Whatever I need is typically in stock. Are the singles/prices higher than online? Yes. But I happily pay a bit more (typically ~10% more than the lowest TCG Player price) in exchange for all of the additional value we get from the shop. Some reviews about the shop being discriminatory or exclusive surprised me - as a regular shopper and new weekly Commander player, I always see a very diverse player population and the staff are very welcoming. Don't give up on the local play groups! Try the Meeple!"

I went back a few weeks later to pick up an online order I had placed 30 minutes before closing (and it was a one card order) and the owner's mother again discriminated against me by locking the door once seeing my boyfriend get out of the car as well. Not only have I been shown disgusting behavior towards me personally but the store price gouges like no other I have ever seen on TCG single buying and selling. On top of this the recent Disney Lorcana release that was supposed to be released to the public, the store took the inventory they got, opened up boxes, and are reselling some of the singles for almost 500% of their TCG Player market price. They're stopping me from enjoying my hobbies and everyone from getting a chance to play Lorcana and get their hands on cards without paying an arm and a leg. And before you think anything else, plenty of stores are selling the products at the correct pricing and still making profit. This store is just filled with greedy, rude, and homophobic staff, it's 2023, it's disgusting..."

They will not hesitate to do a special order for you. They have an amazing selection of MTG cards, both in pack form or singles. They have a huge selection of board games, and they have several of them open in the game room for you to try out before you buy. Their game room is huge with SO many tables. Even on a crowded weekend evening, I've never struggled to find a place to sit. You can show up for events on their calendar, or anytime for casual play with friends. They serve draft beer, sodas, snacks, and local baked goods. I really like this place!"

I proceeded to visit a few more times over the course of a week trading in cards and purchasing the ones I needed for the MANY Commander decks I'm building. I was quite pleasantly surprised during my most recent visit the other day to learn that I've purchased enough that I was rewarded with store credit, which really helped me with my deck building. I still think that night one of the employees could have spared a couple minutes to sell one card, especially since they had a backroom completely full of players and 15 minutes left, but so far I like the store and am glad I discovered it so quickly after moving here. So I'm updating the stars for my review.\n\nOriginal review:\nThere was ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE for not taking a couple of minutes to sell ONE card when there were TWO employees there, still FIFTEEN MINUTES until closing, AND the back room was FULL of people still playing!!! ONE of the two employees COULD have taken a couple minutes to sell ONE card while the other continued sweeping while the back room was FULL of people still playing!!! IF I had arrived with only 5 minutes to closing AND the back room was EMPTY instead of FULL of players, THEN it would have been understandable to say come back tomorrow or order online, but NOT when there was still FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT AND A BACK ROOM COMPLETELY FULL OF PEOPLE STILL PLAYING THEIR GAMES!!!!! That was absolute BS!!!! Such a disappointment for the ONLY Magic The Gathering card shop in the area."
