You can even see a bunch of fish through the window in their aquaponics room. It felt nice to be in a place where the associates and customers care about the world and want to make a difference. It gave me hope that I have not had about climate change in a while. My iced caramel latte was quickly ingested from how refreshing and yummy it was, and my Dad's Americano was good but not the best he has had in his lifetime. The barista was kind enough to explain to me what the place is all about and I enjoyed perusing their sustainable gifts for sale. They also have wine, beer, and kombucha, so if you are not into coffee, there is still something for you. I wish I had time to sit down and enjoy my drink there but was in a hurry. It is very spacious and full of light, which is my idea of a great and chill hangout. I will go back!"
