Same with expensive blueberries.  Avacado was brown runny mush this morning. Orange sections were soft and not firm as usual. The veggies all seem to be fine. I love the store and will continue to shop there as I have never had this kind of experience before. But avoid discounts on Produce on Thursdays."

Now the line is really long behind me and my items would have qualified for the discount. So I asked the cashier to enter a number so I do not hold up the line any further. She told me to fill out a new form. I told her that there is a long line and I don't want to hold up everybody for something so simple. She said not to worry. But worry I did. I just paid full price for everything so I did not hold up other patrons who were waiting patiently. JUST AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. In any other store, the employees would be ok doing this, but not here. They just need better training, better management, and better understanding of the issues. Fortunately, Harris Teeter and Publix both are very close and I promise you neither of those stores would have done that.\n\nAnd before posting this, I went on their website to rely this episode to see if they would respond. CRICKETS! Just goes to show how much they value their customers. You lost a customer for good."

We were there met with a man named Raymond, and all seemed normal until he said, \"let's see how fast I can do this\". We laughed. But soon would that laugher turn into awe. Raymond began his scanning, but in the blink of an eye he was already finished. He was moving so fast that everything was a blur, and once he had started he was already done, ready for us to pay. We sat there, with jaws gaping open in complete shock. Laws of physics were broken. Light speed had been reached. I now know that something CAN be in two places at once thanks to Raymond. The next time you visit the Providence Road Fresh Market please ask for Raymond, so you too can have the life-changing experience that we just did. I truly believe that my third eye has been opened. Nirvana has been achieved."

I continue to give you guys a second chance but I am continuously just disappointed at the quality and presentation of your items. I have better luck at whole foods and the teeter.  Too bad because the location and building are great.\nAnd why did you stop selling the Spinach artichoke dip?? Hope you guys do better in the future"

Things have changed since new management came in and construction of the new Fresh Market was announced.  The employees remained and are still the best part of the grocery store but the quality of produce has fallen and availability of it is inconsistent, including the meat department.  I believe the trucks deliver over the weekend so my general experience of availability degrades throughout the work week.  I've lost count how many times I've come to this store and something as simple as lettuce, tomatillos, or even chicken is not available.  Complaints generally solicit an apology at best, or a finger pointed towards management at worst.  The possibility of change feels rather futile until the new store opens.\n\nI still walk here regularly to get some things but if you need something in a pinch, you're rolling the dice on disappointment.  There are two nearby Harris Teeters in the meantime, with a Publix on the way."
