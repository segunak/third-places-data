They were delicious--some of the best empanadas I've ever had and not a bad price either! Definitely coming back again!"

That is why I gave this place three stars instead of two.\n\nMy boyfriend was actually pretty upset at our visit to this place. When our drinks were serve, they were given sloppy you have to go up and grab them and he said that both drinks were sitting in a puddle that he basically cleaned up while also cleaning up our drinks , just felt like since it was basically Starbucks prices that you know it should be about the same service as Starbucks. But beyond this, he became more disappointed when both of our food wasn't good. His fruit wasn't ripe, it was like halfway frozen or something... and my breakfast burrito had almost no flavor.\n\nThe people that work here are pretty awesome though ."

If I didn't pay for these, then I probably wouldn't have eaten them. It tasted like the oil was old since they had a weird taste to them too.\n\nI ordered the following empanadas:  nutella & strawberry, date & goat cheese, and guava & cheese. The date and goat cheese lost most of its filling while being fried and the nutella & strawberry also had minimal filling. The guava & cheese had a good amount of filling but it was mostly just cheese. I have had my fair share of empanadas and these probably rank as some of the worst unfortunately."

This dish is supposed to come with salsa and a fruit cup. It used to consistently always be delivered with both of those items, but in the past few months there is now only a 10% chance that, if ordered, the wrap will come with salsa and a fruit cup. More often than not, I only get the wrap. It's pretty disappointing, because the salsa essentially made that wrap so delicious. Without it, it's rather bland. I make do by adding salt or my own hot sauce, but it isn't the same. Additionally, in the past few months every single time I get this wrap, it has been increasingly greasy. When I pick it up, it literally drips grease. \"No problem,\" I thought initially, \"I'll just wipe up the excess with a napkin.\" Nope. It's as if the grease is coming from some source of infinite grease within the wrap. I wish they would pay more attention when making these, and when packing them up for delivery. It makes it less enjoyable when they don't. I don't know if they got a new cook/chef recently, or what, but if that is the case, I hope they get them trained up pretty soon. I miss my yummy veggie scramble wrap."

But it was really the service that sets this apart from other establishments. The lady who took my order walked me through all the holiday beverage option ingredients and we went back and forth in conversation as they all sounded delicious. She also gave her personal favorites. Originally I had ordered potato salad as the side. Because my order was vegetarian, the lady prepping it came out to ask if I was okay with the potato salad having bacon  in it. Which I was not. Thank you for hiring good kind people. And thank you staff for caring, and preventing me from eating bacon!"

Until recently, for some reason, their staff really did not know what is in their food. I asked about the ingredients in three items on their menu, none of the staff knew what's in them. I ended up getting a chocolate parfait which the staff confirmed to me that was made of yogurt. It was not yogurt. It's chocolate jello with whipped cream and I ended up having intense nausea and stomach ache afterwards because of the jello. Will not visit again."

I ordered a yogurt parfait, an iced coffee, and a sandwich which i cant remember the name of but very similar to a caprice sandwich. Everything was delicious, the yogurt parfait was creamy with plenty of fruit with some granola and a touch of what tasted like local wildflower honey, the iced coffee actually tasted of coffee instead of sugar syrup and wasnt 99% ice either, the sandwich was perfectly balanced in flavor and texture, they used fresh mozzarella that was soft and delicate but flavorful with fresh basil and very soft and ripe tomatoes. Will definitely be visiting again soon."
