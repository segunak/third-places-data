They told me the frappes are made with cold brew and I suggested mine to be made with espresso shots so it actually tastes like coffee but they just made it with more cold brew than the first time and sadly it still tasted like milk and sugar just a little bit less icy. I love the place and atmosphere and as long as you get hot coffee you can't go wrong but the frappes could be a LOT better."

I requested a replacement with 4 shots because the coffee was overly milky, and I couldn't taste the beans.\n\nThe server took my cup, added another shot of espresso on top, and returned it as is. This action felt rude to me. When I asked again, expressing my willingness to pay more, I requested a latte with 4 shots.\n\nHowever, I was charged 10 bucks for another Large, disappointing, frothy coffee, once again.\n\nDespite paying for the coffee again, it turned out to be even worse. I was charged twice (20 bucks) for subpar coffee.\n\nIn the meantime, the owner came out and inquired about the coffee issue, but the server interrupted, claiming she had taken care of it.\n\nI'm uncertain if there was a racist undertone, perhaps because of my ethnicity, but the overall experience left me feeling that the service was very rude."

Perfect latte foam and even nice art to go with it. The foam lasted for hours!\n\nWe also both got food. I recommend the ribeye melt it is pure flavor town. The lox bagel has a generous amount of lox on it. Our only nitpicking critique is to chop the onions a little finer. That would shoot it over the moon.\n\nIt was moderately busy when we came in and we got our drinks and food quickly. I would definitely come back!"

If you pull in near Target, it's your first left after the gas station. If you enter on the Lowes side, you have to turn right, once you see the pond, it will be across from you.\n\nIf you're a black coffee drinker, this is a great place to get a good pour over or french press. A lot of non-chain coffee shops only have good espresso drinks but their standard coffee is mediocre, this place isn't one of those. Many if not all of their coffee selections are organic.\n\nThey also have pretty good pastries and sandwiches. There are also a lot of vegan options including pastries."

He picked up what they called a gingerbread scone for me and a blueberry muffin for himself. First of all I was shocked that two items cost $10. Secondly, the scone was one of the worst things I've ever had. It didn't taste like gingerbread or cinnamon, or nutmeg, or ginger it had a weird sour taste. It was extremely dry and not sweet at all. It did not have the texture of a scone. More like dry coarse bread. Needless to say I couldn't eat it. I tried a piece of the muffin and again was very disappointed. It was gummy and dense. Completely inedible. So we wasted $10 and got nothing. I won't go back there again."

I am at Waterbean on Sam Furr road in Hunterville and I ordered a mango boba blended with popping boba inside. I order this same drink every time and usually get the same thing every time. Today Wednesday november 3rd at 3:55 pm I ordered the same thing I have every time and instead of it being orange like it has been every time I order it, the drink was brown. I asked the younger barista with brown hair if it was mango flavor and she said \"yes, that's what you wanted right?\" And I said yes and took a sip and it tasted nothing like mango was creamy instead of sweet like normal. I went back and said hi sorry to bother you i'm not sure if this is mango and she said \"no it is mango, I made it\" and I decided I'd rather not fight her about it. What caused me to really write this is that she was talking to two of her friends who were studying at the high top the entire time I was ordering, and while I walked away the 2nd time she said to her friend \"Wow, didn't know you worked here\" and laughed at me. This is the first time I've had a bad time at water bean and that was completely uncalled for especially when I have ordered this drink almost 100 times and never had it be brown.This is extremely disrespectful of her especially after I added a nice tip to my order for her.\nThe website only allows for 80 characters in the comments so I decided to leave a review..."

We stopped here for breakfast after staying in a nearby hotel. There is tons of outdoor seating and there is a green space right in front that was great for kids to run around. The bathrooms were awful however and when you have kids it just super disappointing to have to manage that process in a nasty bathroom. The garbage cans in the stalls were completely full from the day before (we were there before 8am)  and the cobwebs hanging from the ceiling were covered in dust so it's been a while since that bathroom had a good cleaning. The handicap stall was also super dusty- the walls, the baseboards, the handicap rails . If you just want a nice coffee its a great break from Starbucks but just go somewhere else to pee."

Sometimes regular size sometimes the 16oz. Today was no different. However, much to my surprise when the barista handed me my to go cup today it felt a bit on the light side. When I opened the cup, I see that she's handed me half a cup of coffee. I asked her AND the other barista on shift why this was and they both stated that that's what a pour over is. I explained that the many other times I've ordered this drink it's never a half a cup of coffee. The response \"I don't know what happened those other times, but that's what a pour over is.\" (To be fair, they weren't rude, just clueless) Uuummmm, no, this it's what a pour over is. I dropped the issue cause frankly, they were clueless, no point in continuing a conversation that was going nowhere. But where it SHOULD have gone was the baristas doing anything within their power to figure out what went wrong.  And also, my pour over tasted watered down  A watered down, half a cup of coffee....\n\nSo now I'm wondering, am I going to have to go back to Starbucks for my pour over wants? I prefer Waterbean. But mostly I prefer CONSISTENCY. I hope whoever manages this place sees this review. The two baristas that were on shift today would probably work better with more experienced baristas, because together they are a clueless situation.\n\nI'll go back to Waterbean. Hopefully I won't encounter this situation again."
