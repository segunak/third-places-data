I took off some stars specifically for the property management group- they no longer allow fonta flora to validate parking and it's very disappointing.  We've had book club for several years at fonta flora and they would validate our parking. The 90 min free parking is plenty of time to eat at one of the restaurants but a brewery makes its money on people staying for longer to enjoy a few drinks and good company. This needs to be resolved and fonta flora needs to be able to validate parking again"

            "review_text": "This place has gained variety and popularity throughout the post covid years. The choices of eateries and welcoming easy going atmosphere is what attracts people what I feel. Their parking is free for 1.5 hours if you register in some app (can do it once you reach there). Parking fine is high like $55 and you get a bill suddenly after 3 months. So be careful and thank me later."

It's busy but not extremely crowded even on a weekend. I got the Ethiopian food and it was delicious! The girls were so polite too. My husband tried the Bun shop and he was happy with his food too. They have Asian, bars, fusions, salads, smoothies, bbq. If you're looking for a healthy bite, they have it. Or just an ice cream treat or an alcoholic drink to relax. This is a cool spot to hang out with friends or get a quick lunch."

I suggest the chicken and cheese empanada and get the spinach one to top off all the flavors. The sauces were also super flavorful and fresh! They also have side salads if you want a low carb option!! My four year old niece was also with me and she was able to visit Archer Paper Goods where they had kids toys for her to pick out with a decent price. Great experience and I truly can't wait to go back with my family!"

Apparently we were 18 minutes over the free parking time limit. It is hilarious to me that Optimist Hall puts their parking reviews on a different page to not bring down their stars. Everyone please look at Optimist Hall Parking reviews. Hundreds of people have received $50 tickets while they were inside spending their money and providing business to Optimist Hall.

This place really is gem and I hope that it expands. The center needs more spots like this! We ate dessert and then lunch and played corn hole. Then toured some of the shops.

I like the ambience of this place too, very modern, clean, and fun.\nThey also have water filling station so you can just ask for clear cup and fill your water.\nThe optimist hall also offer 90 minutes free parking so make sure you scan the barcode and enter your license plate #. I heard they are very strict with the parking so pay attention to your parking time.\nHopefully we can come and visit this place again next time we visit Charlotte."

Apparently the fee was $5 to park which I was unaware of and the fine for failure to pay was $45. I tried to appeal explain the situation and offered to pay the original $5 fee. I included a weather report that showed severe rain from 8-10pm on 5/17. Long story short I still had to pay the fine which is ridiculous. This fine is excessive  and is almost predatory. I will make sure I never return to Optimist Hall."

Parking is somewhat hard as it was very crowded. Then you only get 90 minutes for free parking.  You also need to put in your credit card and register your car because if you go over the 90 minutes you will get a big parking fine without a CC.\n\nThe hall itself was a little confusing.  Once we got to the 2nd floor, you need to keep walking around to see all the food places.  It was very crowded as it was a Saturday.  We settled on the Jewish Deli, Schrieber's on Rye and the food was simply amazing.  It was a little expensive for 2 sandwiches but worth it.\n\nThe parking ended up costing us $5.99 which was billed and processed to our CC.(total we might have been there 2 hours), which they overcharged us!  So will not be eating here again due to the paid parking situation.\n\n3 stars for overcharging us on the parking!"

We got cubanos which were totally delicious (and I recommend), but there are all kinds of eateries in this food hall for whatever you fancy. You have to walk around and figure out which one or ones you want, then go order, then go find a spot to sit. It can get incredibly crowded here. But it is a great place to have a work lunch or meet clients. Totally recommend. The parking is weird and they take pix of your license plates for payment and such, but besides that it's really a cool place with both inside and outside seating, extremely nice service when ordering, and an overall \"professional chill\" vibe when school is in session."

Try to call them and ask about it and you get nothing!  You also need to really think long and hard about the next 10 years and how you are going to make it with your absurd rules around parking. We are coming there to eat and are in cars since it's impossible to get there any other way...you don't burden us with your parking problems.

I love that it was all privately owned businesses.  Nice tables and seats all over inside and out. Nice place to sit around and catch up. The only negative thing I have to say is that the hard wooden benches do take a toll on your butt after a while."
