You can taste the turmeric and cinnamon and see the sediment of the ingredients at the bottom of the cup; a sign that they use actual dried ingredients and not just flavored syrups.\n\nThey also let me use my reusable cup which makes me happy. The shop was playing all the 90s/2000s throw back jams when I visited. It's clean, comfortable and has multiple seating areas. There is outdoor seating as well. Lots of drink options that don't involve coffee which is a plus. Service was super friendly. Parking is very accessible and easy."

This place is exactly that.\nIn a deep pool Starbucks, they stand out the perfect gem  a great coffee shop with incredibly tasteful decor.\nBonus the coffee shop feels so comfortable that you just want to spend the day there. I spent a few hours there in an open space and then I reserved a quiet to host a virtual meeting.\nI love that you have the freedom to reserve the quiet spaces away from the music and noise of the coffee shop. They even have a cute preservable meeting room that has a monitor & etc.\nI appreciate that the Internet was very strong might be a silly thing to some, but often I find in public spaces it's hard to host meetings without connection issues.\nI had a delicious iced chai with oat milk, then a glass of Prosecco. Did I mention that they have a full bar too?\nThis is the perfect spot to host any sort of group, gatherings, or meetups and because of the style of the place also perfect to capture clips or pics for social. The staff was very pleasant and engaging as well as the other patrons. The fun thing about places that have great energy is that they typically draw other people with equally great energy making it a really cozy environment.\nTotal Bonus-even the bathrooms are cute and clean!!\nThanks for being so intentional with this coffee shop! I don't live nearby, but I will be back anytime in the area"

Inventive and well executed we ordered the Orange Dreamsicle and the Dark and Stormy, both were refreshing and picturesque! They are very much a family-owned establishment and one of the owners made our drinks! The conversation and atmosphere will keep us going back!\n\nThe next morning we decided we needed to try their coffee to give a really in depth review. We both got the Honey Bee Latte but tried it iced and hot. Both were phenomenal! They also have boba tea on their menu which is so hard to find outside of the city! That's up next on my list of things to try.\n\nThey have areas you can set up your laptop and work from, an area for small meetings, comfortable couches, locally sourced wood tables, and some outdoor seating as well!\n\nTLDR; Whether you just need a good drink or somewhere to get some work done during the week - give Wake Coffee Co a shot!"

So saying this is rare but this is a special place I love everything about it mainly it's different it's edgy and modern but at the same time comfortable with a welcoming staff that's not upselling you for extras the whole time. Very knowledgeable and just great people. I enjoyed the whole experience. The menu is great it's not obnoxiously big but it is diverse, eclectic, well thought out, and has both the classic option but also some really cool new drinks I haven't heard of I had a bubble tea I believe and it was spectacular. Aiden you were great thanks for all of the help!  You guys knocked this concept out of the park!!  Great job I will be back a lot"
