This Black woman-owned gem isn't just a coffee shop; it's a celebration of community, culture, and quality.\n\nThe decor is effortlessly cool, blending cozy vibes with an unapologetically bold style that reflects the strength and creativity of its owner. Every detail, from the curated playlist to the artwork on the walls, feels intentional and inviting.\n\nNow let's talk coffee -- rich, smooth, and expertly brewed. Whether you're grabbing a classic latte or trying one of their signature drinks (highly recommend the Dirty chai Latte), each cup is a masterpiece. The pastries and small bites? Equally divine, often locally sourced and always delicious.\n\nWhat really sets this spot apart, though, is the energy. The owner and her team radiate passion and purpose. You're not just a customer here -- you're part of something. A space that uplifts, nourishes, and reminds you what it means to support local, Black-owned excellence.\n\nThis place is more than coffee -- it's culture in a cup. Don't walk, run."

I've never really been a coffee shop person, but this place made a newbie like me feel right at home. I've been here a handful of times now--sometimes to read and enjoy a drink, other times to have a meeting and introduce a colleague to this gem of a space.\n\nRight now, I'm fixated on the **Foxy Brown**, and the **blueberry muffin** has me in a chokehold. There are so many great things to say about Archive, but honestly, it's one of those places you just have to experience for yourself. The ambiance sparks both creativity and productivity, making it the perfect spot to work, relax, or connect. Definitely a must-visit!"

I love that it's in west Charlotte!  I love sharing this gem with my friends.  An iced dirty chai or the foxy brown (hot or iced) are my go to drinks.  Bonus points:  The owner is super dope, kind, creative, and personable!  She recently had an exhibit at the Mint Museum in Uptown and I thoroughly enjoyed it and appreciated it!"

I promise, you won't regret it!!!\n\nSee you there soon!!!!!!\n\n*I was not paid to post this review."

The seemingly manager or team lead tried to correct the problem, however we were shocked at the disrespect and proceeded with the refund request. In the end we were looking forward to establishing a long lasting customer relationship as well as offering recommendations to family and friends. The customer service received was unexpected and highly disappointing and add insult to injury the barista chimed in after the refund was being processed and say \" it was for 2, right\"?...unbelievable! So if the barista remembered that info of the order, why did they not fulfill the order? Just unbelievable and never again! In the end we were redeemed at Starbucks "
