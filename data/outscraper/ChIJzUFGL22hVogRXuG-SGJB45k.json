I love that it's in west Charlotte!  I love sharing this gem with my friends.  An iced dirty chai or the foxy brown (hot or iced) are my go to drinks.  Bonus points:  The owner is super dope, kind, creative, and personable!  She recently had an exhibit at the Mint Museum in Uptown and I thoroughly enjoyed it and appreciated it!"

I promise, you won't regret it!!!\n\nSee you there soon!!!!!!\n\n*I was not paid to post this review."

The seemingly manager or team lead tried to correct the problem, however we were shocked at the disrespect and proceeded with the refund request. In the end we were looking forward to establishing a long lasting customer relationship as well as offering recommendations to family and friends. The customer service received was unexpected and highly disappointing and add insult to injury the barista chimed in after the refund was being processed and say \" it was for 2, right\"?...unbelievable! So if the barista remembered that info of the order, why did they not fulfill the order? Just unbelievable and never again! In the end we were redeemed at Starbucks "
