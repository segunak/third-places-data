Bartender asked (who I'm assuming is) the owner/manager if they did, which they didn't, but the (again, I'm assuming) owner/manager let me fill out a tiny form so that he can try to get it in stock and contact me when it is. That's the kind of customer service that will make me remember a place and go back again. Well done Rhino!"

Probably a year later comes 2nd try, at the morehead location. I called in a couple of breakfast orders just fine. However when I arrived without warning to learn that they don't accept cash over 20.00 and the only bill I had was a 50.00 bill on me, I received no help in the matter except an excuse that the owner has this policy. To the owner if your going to be cowardly about accepting cash I suggest your more up front about this. And hopefully adjust accordingly if a circumstance like these occur. We as people are not robots and if they would have been able to accommodate me somehow I might have been a consistent, loyal customer and supporter of your business."

The girl took it personally like I was trying to argue and was frustrated that the threat of not serving me can't work since I had already decided I wouldn't spend money here. She then childishly demanded I give the mask back bc \"they're not free\" (ironically she had just handed it to me for free) No one has ever been rude to me here until today and personally it's not anyone's business what medical issues I face. If you want to wear a mask and think it helps thats great. Good for you. But for the rest of us that need an inhaler to walk up on flight of steps (plus my claustrophia) it's really ridiculous. You aren't saving the world your just over stepping your boundaries with peoples personal health decisions and Its not right. The stupid have taken over the planet."
