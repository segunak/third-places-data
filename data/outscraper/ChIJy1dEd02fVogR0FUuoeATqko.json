I still use my card for e-books, I just don't need to visit in person to do that.\n\nPretty much the only reason I come to the library is because I need to print something. Who has a printer? Not me. Printing was free for a bit at the library which was nice, but they've started charging again. It's only 25 cents per page for black and white and 50 cents per page for color which is well worth not having to deal with a printer for me.\n\nThis isn't my normal library, but it was on our way when we were running errands so we stopped here instead. There's a convenient app you can use to upload and print your documents. The reason for the lower than normal rating here is because none of the librarians knew how to use it.\n\nThe app is straightforward if you're adding a printer for the first time. Unfortunately, I had my normal library set up already and couldn't figure out how to add another library. The librarians only seemed to know how to repeat the instructions on the sign (which assumed you had never set up a printer before).\n\nI ended up having to email the stuff to myself, log into a computer, and print from there which is more time consuming. The computers also turn off immediately 10 minutes before it closes so I was in a race with the clock. It shut down seconds after I clicked print.\n\nI hope they get the issues with the app resolved so you can have more than one library (or inform staff how to do that). Until then, I'll stick to my normal library."
