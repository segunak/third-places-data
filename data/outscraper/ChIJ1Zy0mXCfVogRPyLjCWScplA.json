            "review_text": "Hey NJC, I don't normally do this but after the same thing's happened to me twice, I feel the need to point it out for QA sake and to see if something can be done to make things right.\n\nHere's the sitch: so at 11:21 AM on June 9th, I ordered an iced latte and a muffin for breakfast from here. I get there within minutes of course, I usually place the order on the drive there, and pick up my drink from the counter and head over to the room next door to pick up the food part of my order since there's a sign there that says \"food pickup here\" or whatnot. Simple, right? Only, my muffin never comes. I notice on the table the only food items waiting to be picked up are all the more lavish items on the food menu like waffles or toast or whatever. Odd, I think, but I don't linger on it. I waited almost 10 minutes after the time my order was supposed to have been ready: I get it, maybe the kitchen's backed up or whatnot. Still, nothing comes. I eventually leave without my muffin. It's all good, it was just a few bucks. I think to myself maybe I caught the business at a bad time and they forgot that part of my order? No worries! It happens.\n\nI place just about the same order on the 15th at 9:54 AM and head over to pick it up within minutes, only this time the place was absolutely packed and busy. All good, considering the time I walk in. As usual, I pick up my drink and head over to the food pickup table in the other room, again noticing all the items waiting to be picked up are waffles or toast or whatnot. So I wait a few minutes again. Nothing. I ask one of the workers nearby for help and at first, say that it's an order for Christian but then re-clarify and say it's an order for \"Chris B\" after remembering that's what I placed the order under. So she walks over behind the counter where you pick up drinks and looks for it, inquiring with one of the baristas. I take a seat and wait, she comes back shortly after and shows me a receipt with someone else's name and asks if this is it. Not my order. She then tells me I'd have to pick it up from the counter. That's completely new information to me: so I think to myself that's pretty odd considering there's no clear signage around the shop saying that's where you'd pick up smaller bakery items and there isn't anything on the Odeko app saying that either? At this time, there's a very long line at the counter and I was short on time so I left immediately after, sans muffin, and truthfully I didn't feel like waiting in line to pick up an order I placed on the app ahead of time.\n\nSo NJC, I was wondering if I could just be refunded my $7 - accounting for both muffins I never got? I just don't want this to leave a bad taste in my mouth. If it helps create kind of a customer profile too, NJC Atherton - really NJC in general - is a personal favorite of mine. I love going to all your locations really and I love the coffee and vibes :) Been an avid patron since 2017, got the receipts to prove it, Odeko could probably verify lol. Please help! I have both receipts for both orders mentioned upon request. Look forward to further correspondence."

The drinks are made from organic coffee, the milk is locally produced and is not as processed as your average commercial milk, and they have other great non-dairy options also. The iced caramel latte is to die for. They make their own caramel.  The atmosphere in the shop is amazing, with live plants and open sky lights. Plenty of room for seating and the barista are always such nice and patient people. I can't recommend Not Just Coffee, especially this location enough."

It's a fairly new place, started in 2011, but the people that work there always know what they are doing and have a passion for it. Would highly recommend to any coffee lovers that live in the Charlotte area or just passing theiugh."
