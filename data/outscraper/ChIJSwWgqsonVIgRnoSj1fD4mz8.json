The interior is modern, but lacks the cozy vibe that Dilworth had. The most upsetting part was the sticker shock of ordering a tiny piece of quiche only to realize it was almost $9- tasted good but that price is insane!! Before leaving a review I wanted to also try coffee-- so I ordered a latte, and again faced the insanity of overcharging-- oat milk costs an additional $1.35- $8 for a latte with no flavoring/syrup. The coffee wasn't bad but wasn't great by any means-- espresso tasted burnt. The barista was nice but there's obviously poor management going on as it's Veterans Day and witnessed a vet come in for a free drip coffee (as posted on Instagram) and was told that the store wasn't offering it. He left visibly upset. Certainly will not be returning and will be continuing to grieve the loss of Dilworth coffee!!"
