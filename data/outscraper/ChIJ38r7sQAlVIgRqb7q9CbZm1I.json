Cathy offers several delicious latte options for vegans and lactose intolerant. My favorite is a soy latte. When I'm up for a treat, I'll add a pump of pumpkin spice syrup. Cathy also has yummy home baked goods  from a local baker. The mini coffee crumb cakes and almond poppy seed muffins are to die for. What ever  your coffee or tea desires are, you'll be sure to find it at Cathy's Coffee."

Cathy works hard as the sole owner and employee and is excellent with customer service, knowing her customers well.\n\nFour stars because I have found the wifi speed to be pretty low compared to other coffee places I've visited and they close at 3, which is a bummer - would love a late night coffee shop but I understand the business might not be there.\n\nIf you're near here, you should come by. She'll take good care of you!"
