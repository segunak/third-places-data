When I say it's split right down the middle, it's 50/50 shared, which provides an interesting layout.\n\nFor Caribou, they have plenty of signage displaying what their specials are & what they offer. They provide plenty of to-go snacks & Caribou products. Their design for their side of the building shows a cabin like feel. The cabin like design does provide a cozy feel.\n\nThe staff was helpful with providing options for drinks that fit our tastes.\n\nThe vanilla espresso shaker I got was enjoyable. The bean didn't taste burnt & the vanilla didn't overwhelm the espresso or oakmilk. This provided a nice balance between the flavors. The BOUsted drink my wife got was sweet but provided the caffeine jolt she was looking for.\n\nThe area where the drinks & staff were located was clean. The dining area was clean as well. The bathrooms were in rough shape. They could use a deep clean. A remodel may be a long-term solution, but I had to clean the toilet to the best of my ability prior to using.\n\nOverall, this is a good spot to grab a quick drink in between shopping or running errands."

I get there and order my coffee and everything without a hiccup. Then when I go up to the counter ask the barista if the cup sitting there was mine, she VERY rudely says, \"by the way dogs are NOT welcome inside.... that's your coffee\".\n\nNot being dog friendly is 100% fine, I checked the BringFido app to avoid this situation, but obviously the app was wrong. However, that is no excuse to be so nasty to me and my dog. It was just extremely uncalled for. Not to mention there were literally other dogs inside, but somehow we were the only ones getting reprimanded? This experience really turned me off from Caribou and I don't think we'll be going back.\n\nPhoto attached is Peaches after we got the boot :)"
