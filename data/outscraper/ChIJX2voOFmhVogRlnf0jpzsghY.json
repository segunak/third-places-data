Expect Southend prices.\n\nThe fire chicken I purchased was weird. Chicken breast laying on top of a \"spicy\" sauce which was spicier than mayonnaise but less so than Texas Pete. Shredded cheese was layered on top, similar to microwave nachos. Flavor profile resembles tv dinner.\n\nI've been to the other location, which is partially why I'm being harsh.

The meat was tender and juicy and delicious and at the price they were the best.\n\nNow I haven't had their ribs since January of this year when they were still $25 for a nice size/weight, primarily because the cost went up to $45.\n\nNow I know the cost of every is up, but the cost increase if 80% put me off until I decided to try them today on preparation of some family visiting.\n\nOh boy was that a mistake and not even solely because of the price. Now you would expect with the 80% increase in cost, they would offer the same sized rib (the weight was much less when I up my to go order, the only way I have ever ordered) with at the very least the same taste. But this rib was about 30% smaller, dryer and less tender nor did it taste as good. When I purchased in the past the meat would last two days for me and my wife.\n\nI know meat can be hit or miss, but I had previously, prior to January 2024 order it 4 times and it was always the same.\n\nI'm just writing this as a warning, don't waste your money on the ribs. It's not worth the cost of $45 just go somewhere else for the ribs.\n\nAll their other food seems about the same, I ordered some wings and they were good."

            "review_text": "Horrible experience. Craziest part is that is wasn't even the the bartender or the cooks... it was surprisingly the MANAGER of this location. We ordered about $100 worth of food and drinks unfortunately one of the drinks we had my partner was allergic to and the bartender decided to offer a different drink. The MANAGER shortly after decided to hound out the bartender about the drink in front of us. That alone made us feel super uncomfortable to enjoy our food. I still decided to continue to eat my food. My wings were very very dry and I had asked the cooks for more sauce in which there was ton of communication between them as if they have been ordered to not offer more wing sauce because of cost. I then asked for one of their pre packaged sauces in which they had to discuss further before the trying to provide me with packed ketchup because that indeed was the cheapest sauce they had. I wouldn't have mind paying the difference. This was at their church street location.\n\nTHE MANAGER the decided to walk up and approach me behind my back. He then tried to make it seem as if there was a problem for asking for sauce. I informed him with consideration of paying close to $100 I didn't understand why asking for honestly anything that night was a problem. He then went on to say he didn't have to get sauce and that I could leave which was before we could even eat our food. I then asked for a refund because we couldn't eat our food in which he RAISED his voice to say no and that I'd have no luck even if I tried to dispute with the transaction. He then walked away into his office and slammed the door on us in front of ALL the staff and the customers that were there.\n\nIn conclusion, he was pissed because I guess he felt they lost a total of $3.25 that night for remaking the drink and the providing a sauce when instead he now has lost $100 in total because of his horrible hospitality that didn't exist and horrible customer service. Imagine telling your employees to penny nickle and dime with the 10 customers they had come in that night and now he himself has lost the company $100.\n\nHe never walked up to even ask if we were having a good experience in which that alone I would probably came back 3 more times after meaning they could've made $400 of me.\n\nGood luck explaining to the owners how now you they're -$100 and you're losing more money than the employees here he suppose to manage and report to him.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE. UNPROFESSIONAL. IRATE. DEMEANING. CHEAPSKATE. = Manager"

Receipt read what we said. Order with a mild brown sauce that was NOT what we ordered, nor was it the original soy garlic. It was one we'd never had before in all the years of eating here. And not only was the sauce wrong, there were NO WINGS in the order. They were all BREADED drumstick lollipops. And because there were breaded with a thick breading, it fell off, revealing the fatty layer of unseasoned skin. We asked the staff about the sauce issue and were told that \"mgmnt decided to experiment with the sauce but we're changing it back tomorrow.\"\n\nWe paid $2/wing to get a jacked up order that wasn't suitable for a stray dog. Will NOT spend another dime at either establishment. Let the spacious restaurant and grounds that were paid for when it was a decent place fool you.

Splash pad and lots of games.\n\nWe booked the blue Karaoke room for my sons graduation dinner/gathering on a Saturday afternoon between 1-4. The staff and service left a lot to be desired. After waiting a few minutes a member of the staff came and took my debit card and my license. This card was used for both the room and food.\n\nSo we are in the karaoke room with no instructions on how to operate the equipment. Everything is in Korean, so unless you have been before you would be lost and not know how to work the system. I flagged down the staff member who has been helping me and tell her that we have no idea how to work this. It is now 1:30. This room is $120 hr. So yes time is money in this situation. After getting the 30 sec how to from the staff member we proceed to sing our butts off  ....for about another 20 mins before the sound just completely goes out. We contact a different member and they came and did something and got it back to running again. that lasted about 10 minutes before the Ipad attached to the wall with youtube (Yes you have to basically use Youtube and hope that they have the song you want to sing. I was very disappointed by this) decided to lose signal or crash. So then another member had to come and restart the ipad and turn the volume up because the sound was not very loud. I would have to assume that every room has these issues because it wasn't even an option to switch. They provided water pitchers that needed filling multiple times, but no one in sight to do so. All in all we probably lost an hour of actual karaoke time due to all of the issues. Of course in true current times when it came to settle up that 25% tip button was already selected with when it came time to pay . Because it was for my son and he was with his friends I decided not to make a scene or complain. rather I would just share our experience. The rooms are too expensive for what you get. over $400 for 3 hrs."

I've had better kimchi from a gas station in Alabama, which is pretty embarrassing for a Korean fusion restaurant that's charging $6 for a cup. Also, Corona Premier doesn't taste so great when it's $5.50 for a 12-fl.oz. pour.\n\nFor those with gluten sensitivity or celiacs disease: eat before you go. There is nothing for you here. Some versions of the menu say \"gluten friendly\", others say \"gluten free\". This only caters to those who choose not to eat gluten, not those that cannot. All fryers and surfaces are shared, they cannot actually offer anything (as far as I know) that is actually free of gluten.\n\nThe space is cool, the splash pad is nice for kids."

I understand it's \"family style\" portions...but list how many people it will feed.  Along with tipping for self service? Nah.\n\nThe wings are huge and honestly a good deal, but \"cannot serve naked wings with sauce on the side\"\nForreal? Why offer \"naked wings\" if you're not going to serve them with any sort of dipping sauce or sauce on the side?\n\nDrink menu on the tvs is impossible to use. Ten laminated drink menus on the bar, all with different drinks, have to read each menu individually...with ten people also trying to see the physical menus.\n\nThe only decent thing is the entertainment for kids - IF you're an attentive parent. 80% of the parents are not paying attention.\n\nPeople aren't there to watch their children, they're there to get drunk and socialize while their kids are absolute menaces to everyone - spraying people in the face with squirt guns, throwing water on anyone that's near them. Adults and other kids. I had my kid there - it's not hard to supervise.\n\nIf you're going to spend time here, eat first and pregame. You're going to buy a 12oz corona for $6."

Fish sauce is an easy replacement there are many vegan versions that nobody would be able to tell the difference. Please consider making the tofu vegetarian/vegan."

The bulgogi bao buns are messy but delicious; my kids love the chicken tacos and potato swirls. I wish they would have salt on tables and (personal preference) serve Coke rather than Pepsi, bit those are tiny things! They also have private karaoke rooms and my daughter went to a great birthday party in one of those. We bike there - great choice if you can because parking can be tight when it's busy. A really fun destination - love it."

It was quite chaotic and parking was TERRIBLE, but overall a fun time with the kids. The atmosphere was fun. Korean music was playing. Plenty of seating. Drinks being made at the bar. While seated inside, we decided to order food to go since it was getting late and our kids bedtime would be soon. I only ordered two Bao buns. The pulled pork and the beef rib. Service was mediocre. It took about 40 minutes for me to get two bun sliders. And I don't think it would've been quicker until I went up and said something to the cashier. Presentation to go was like it was thrown in the box. The beef rib one was quite tough to chew. The pulled pork one was okay. The pork was tasty on this one, however had a lot more filler than pork. Eh. Was it worth the $12? Maybe. But would I order it again? No."

We were charged for drinks that we never even got and some of our drinks were even left on a tray in the common space instead of handing them to who ordered them. The other disappointing piece was that the karaoke sound kept going in and out. The mics would randomly shut off and the volume in the room would cut out on one side. Not to mention half of the time the volume was so low you couldn't even hear the music. when contacting the workers to help they were unable to provide a resolution. We made the most of it but I would never recommend anyone to this location. I was embarrassed to have put the party guests through that experience."

The food, in general, was delicious, showcasing a diverse range of flavors that truly captured the essence of Korean cuisine. However, my enthusiasm was slightly tempered by the unexpectedly large size of the chicken wings, which, unfortunately, overshadowed their flavor. Despite this minor setback, the rest of the menu offered a delightful array of options, ensuring there's something for everyone.\n\nThe atmosphere at Seoul Food Meat Company is exceptionally family-friendly, making it an ideal spot for gatherings or casual meals. Additionally, the ambiance is conducive to romantic dates, creating a versatile setting that caters to various occasions. What sets this place apart is its expansive layout, providing ample spaces for patrons to relax and enjoy their time. The abundance of seating options makes it easy to find a cozy corner or a spot that suits the mood of your visit.\n\nWhile the food left a positive impression, I found the pricing to be a tad on the higher side, particularly when it comes to the Karaoke rooms. However, considering the overall experience and the restaurant's upscale setting, the cost is somewhat acceptable. It's worth noting that the value you receive in terms of ambiance and variety on the menu helps balance out the prices.\n\nIn terms of service, I found it to be satisfactory. The staff was attentive and accommodating, contributing to the overall positive dining experience. Seoul Food Meat Company is undoubtedly a noteworthy establishment in the Mill District, offering a blend of great food, a family-friendly environment, and a spacious layout. Despite some minor drawbacks, it remains a viable choice for those seeking a diverse culinary experience in a comfortable setting"

Our side was baked Ramen cheese, and it wasn't bad, but it needed more seasoning and definitely more sauce. The noodles were nearly dry and I wanted more flavor. Tons of tv's inside, all playing K-pop, so really cool atmosphere. We'll come back for the pork belly for sure, and there are other things we still haven't tried."

Manager Adam was not professional at all when I reported my experience to him.\nI only ate part of the meal and returned the remaining portion.\nHe offered to credit me for the sides and told me the Rib was not covered.  I had called the next day after my dine incident  and was not responded to for two weeks. Adam held me responsible because he said that I had ignored 3 calls he made to me; even those never left a message. TERRIBLE MANAGER!"

When I told them I wasn't paying for the broccoli salad, it was a bunch of attitude from the manager, like it's my fault they don't know how to prepare something that is worth the price. It's a shame because they have a really nice space that is very family-friendly. The problem is that the food and service are abysmal. I would never recommend going here to anyone. I wish Google would let you give zero stars because this is the worst dining experience I've had in Charlotte in a very long time."

I asked the person at the register about it and they stated  the food does not come out hot. So if you like your food hot, you won't get that here from my experience.  The wings were really good! The cheesesteak eggrolls weren't good they were cold, as were the fries, and not flavorful. The vibe of the restaurant was better than the actual food.  I could have just gone on an off day."

Some of the stuff I got was really good and the other stuff was just ok.\n\nIf I could rate this on a scale of 1 thru 10, I'd give it a 7/10 if not 8/10. Some of the meats on their bao buns and tacos are really good and some aren't. The sides, were ok. I wished they had better sides. The one I ordered wasn't the best sides I've had at a korean themed restaurant.\n\nIf you got money to splurge, then splurge on the bbq beef rib. It's expensive but it was actually pretty good. Much better than I had thought it would have been.\n\nThe atmosphere was great though. Seems like a really cool spot to hangout. Good place to get group of friends together to hangout. The bar looked legit.\n\nThe service was great. And their cleaning crew was great. Parking lot was fairly large given the location of the area."

I could drink the oil from the dirty rice. The brisket was a huge disappointment, dry with a fake smoky flavor. Potato salad was bland and underwhelming.\n\nThe crowd this site brings in on a Saturday around lunch are parents with kids who will take up entire benches for the outside seating area.

All beers are $8 and appetizers are each $7. They also don't keep tabs open so you have to pay each time you go up to order more.\n\nThere's a game room in the back and an outdoor area with tables and a playground for the kids.\n\nPretty big parking lot that is shared with the new food hall that opened next door.

Decided to walk around outside and let me tell you...to the dog park and outdoor water splash park this is something to see in person and experience! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for good food, great drinks, amazing customer service and stunning ambience inside and out."

It's how the rest of that one issue was handled that threw us. When picking up from the counter I noticed everything was wrong, and they forgot an item. So in addition to having to wait for them to remake the whole order after already waiting 20 minutes for the wrong one, the manager directs me to the register to pay for the item THEY forgot to ring up. Really?! You couldn't have comped a taco for the trouble? I guess they could tell how put off I was by this, so they later brought us each a free drink ticket. I went to the bar and got mine with no issue. When my sister went to the bar literally a minute later, the bartender asked if she was with me. She replied yes, and was told the drink tickets are only allowed to be used on our next visit. LOL. You have to laugh at how silly that is. Instead of saying, \"hey, they're meant to be for your next visit, but I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT CUZ NOBODY AROUND HERE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING, so we can make an exception today, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I JUST DID IT FOR THE OTHER PERSON IN YOUR PARTY\" she turned her away. The entire experience felt intentionally backwards. Anyway, yeah, we won't be back and neither will any of the friends we told about what happened."

The staff is also incredibly kind and accommodating! Carley and team go out of their way. I wish every brewery in CLT was like this!\n\nToday they hosted an Easter party with a petting zoo, hidden easter eggs and other treats for the kiddos - it was such a great hit, it's the small stuff for families that mean so much!\n\nI will note that when they originally opened, we had written this place off due to pricing. They do not accept tip as it's a part of their cost, and when they first opened, the amounts didn't add up to  what you would pay for a beer + tip. After revisiting today, their pricing is more in line! (we're happy to pay more of a premium for what they offer the kids, so the new pricing makes more sense!)\n\nSeoul will be our go to place for our family and friends! Looking forward to our next (weekly) visit!"

Bao Buns are to die for; I personally love the Bulgogi and Beef Rib. The staff is very attentive from the bartenders, cleaners and their manager, Courtney. 10/10 recommend! Will definitely be back."

But the reason for my 3 star review is the beer prices. $10 a beer! Come on guys. There's nowhere in Charlotte I pay $10 for a single beer. I wouldn't complain if it was $7 even.. but I feel 10 bucks for a beer is borderline outrageous. It made me stop at two instead of maybe the usual three or four I might have had, and will make me reconsider visiting next time."

There are lots of tasty drink options, and the wings are INCREDIBLE.

My order for hot food was rangup incorrectly.  The kitchen somehow didn't receive my order, and then it came out wrong.  Didn't receive my food until after my entire party was done with their meal.  Brisket was dry and overcooked.  Prices have increased 20-40% at both locations.\nAlso can someone explain the corn silos??\n\nThe only redeeming factor was the manager who came to apologize after the second messup. And there is no tip option, which is appropriate as you collect your own food and drinks and bus your own table."

The food i can't even explain it I'll be writing all day. Drinks and bar staff so helpful, with giving us different drinks to try because they don't have a certain drink menu but they can absolutely make anything your heart desire. we tried everything I'm not joking. EVERYTHING. we had so many trays on our table. I hate i didn't get pictures. This is stuff i never would eaten before. We went with an open mind and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. I had to talk to management. I'm not even joking. Go there as fast as you. The icing on the cake it's a freaking dog park for your pups to casually play and so their duties. Annnnndddddddddd a park for the kiddos. This restaurant picked the perfect location. With or without my review i wish them much success. Hospitality goes a longggggg way with me. We were comfortable i didn't have to squeeze no where or worrying about fitting in a small booth. Let me even brag about the restrooms Huge, each single bathroom is fully closed where no one can peep through the cracks and see you. Lololololol. They have gained us as customers for life."
