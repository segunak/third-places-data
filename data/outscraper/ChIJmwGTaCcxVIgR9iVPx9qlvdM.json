Tyler and Tucker were very friendly,  welcoming and helpful!  They helped us out and answered our questions!  We ordered 2 mocha lattes and a matcha latte.   They were very delicious!  Looking forward to coming back again and try some other coffees!!!  I loved their take-out bag!"

I had a regular coffee and my husband had some coffee with cream and caramel, we both ate some cake that had almonds on top and banana on bottom (I am not sure the name). It was the best I have ever tried here in NC. The reason why I am writing this review just now is because I was looking on Google what time it will be open tomorrow, since We went there We've been dreaming about coming back. It's so affordable coffee place that We could come every week, unfortunately We just don't have time every week. I highly recommend!!! God Bless the ladies behind the scenes to never give up, because everyone needs to know this place! In my opinion it's better and cheaper than Starbucks (which I also love, but not like Sorella)."

One of my friends had a latte and she enjoyed it but another friend had a cappuccino and said it's not good so do what you will with that information. The customer service was great and they were really caring when I asked if they could make an unusual drink. As well, the aesthetic and decor of the coffee shop is cute and very pleasing to the eye!"

I'm so happy it's here (and less than 10 minutes from my house) and 100% worth the hype. Its fall menu is fantastic, but even the regular menu is streamlined and delicious.

            "review_text": "I went here this morning. The place is beautiful and the atmosphere was wonderful. Whomever designed this place has to watch Sweet Magnolia cause I felt like I was in that cute little town. I wanted to grab my laptop and sit there all day!! Next time, can I just take the decor with me to my office where I'm currently sitting to work? Thanks! Now to what everyone wants to know about...the Coffee. It was AMAZING! I got an Iced Carmel Latte with Oat milk and I may or may have not left with an oatmeal cookie at 7:30AM. It was yummy  First of all the Carmel is homemade and I know homemade when I taste it! Starbucks could neverrrrrrrr! Kudos to the owners! Very well thought out and done. Congratulations and thank you for the Coffee... and cookie at 7:30AM "

You can really tell how much thought the owner has put into every detail. I am so excited to have such an awesome new spot in Monroe and can't wait for my next visit."
