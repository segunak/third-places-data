He's awesome.\n\nI see a post or two where people talk about their wait time. For whatever it's worth I think this needs to be taken with a grain of salt. First of all these folks get orders out quickly. But here's a first-hand experience. A friend and I went to Starbucks and we were waiting in line with 6 people in front of us. One of those people had a pretty big multiple order. The wait was long for sure. When we had our coffee and sat down my friend proceeded to give this Starbucks a one-star rating due to the wait time. Come on folks.\n\nAnother thing you see here, and I love seeing it, is it there are several math tutors who uses Starbucks as their home base. I love watching these teenagers absorb information from these experts. It's a fun Starbucks!"
