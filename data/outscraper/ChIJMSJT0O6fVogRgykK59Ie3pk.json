I have NO FOOD ALLERGIES WHATSOEVER, so it makes me wonder what are they doing to the food back there???? I ordered a ham & Gouda melt & a tomota soup, not even 5 minutes into eating I started to feel the allergic reaction. Not only did this happen but this location is also dirty tables weren't clean & they threw the bread for the soups in the bag not wrapping it up or anything. You can tell they don't care for cleanliness OR good service here at this Panera. You are better off going anywhere else but here."

The time before that our delivery was an hour and 15 minutes late...so obviously we were back with patients at that point and did not get to eat."

I understand mistakes a busy times, but attempts to communicate with management have failed.  They do not answer their phones, not even when calling during their preferred non-busy times.  It wouldn't be so bad if they were not already on the expensive side, PLUS adding a $1.00 \"convenience  fee\" for the inconvenince of incorrect orders, plus delivery charge, plus tip for driver collected before delivery is made.  They have just priced and poor-serviced themselves out of my breakfast and lunch habit."

Restrooms are clean.\n\nRight now, when you place your order you get a pager to pick your own food at the counter in the back. I'd suggest grabbing your table and waiting maybe a minute or two after the pager vibrates to avoid people crowding the counter. You may want to order ahead to save time. It takes a few minutes on your phone and I can almost guarantee that your order will be 100% correct versus placing your order at the register. Although, it is rare when they get your order wrong. If they ever do, is usually because another customer took your order.\nThe food is worth it. Really!\nAs a suggestion, because Panera Bread's menu is mostly Carbs, you may want to order the smallest size and then split with someone; just for portion control. You should be able to substitute non-dairy for most drinks. And your order can be fully customized to your liking or dietary restrictions. The menu works much like it does at Starbucks, as far as substitutions go. And please don't be afraid to ask for substitute. They're staff is very friendly and understanding. It may take you a minute to explain what you want but they'll serve you patiently.\nThe bakery options change with the seasons, so you may want to try their pastries every once in a while.\nSo far, they have the best Chai Late I've had. There's also whole loaves of bread that you can ask to be sliced thick or thin. My daughter loves their Mac & Cheese and the sprouted grain bread."

But the sandwich was not a chipotle chicken avocado melt at all like I ordered! It was literally two pieces of plain bread not toasted or anything with half melted American cheese in the middle, barely even warm and wrapped up in soggy paper. I wish I could post the photos I took of it! I have never been so disgusted! So much so I am now rethinking my life choices including ever ordering Panera again, but especially never ordering from/going to this location again! This went straight in the trash. First time I ordered they forgot to give me my cookie I ordered (it was a door dash order) but I made the mistake of giving them a second chance. They did worse this time around. Don't eat here. Panera overall isn't what it used to be sadly."

Neither side of the sandwich was grilled or toasted...soft white bread. I make sure that I go to the Cotswald location and the food quality is 180 degrees different. I don't see how Panera chain can support a franchise serving such a horrible quality of food (every time we have ordered). I will drive any day in lunch hour traffic before I ever order a delivery or any food from this location.

When I arrived to pick it up, they said the customer called in to add more things on a second order and to leave a generous tip for the driver, and that they merged the orders together so they wouldn't have to assign a second Doordash driver. After I completed the delivery, my app only showed a $2.76 tip. Which is fine, a tip is extra anyway but that is extremely unusual amount for an order that large. So I stopped by the Panera afterwords and they told me yes there should've been a $47 tip that was on the second part. So after a night and day full of back and forth with Doordash and Panera customer service, it's Panera's own customer service that tells me the second part was processed as a store pickup, therefore the tip never entered the Doordash system to get to me, and whatever worker at the store kept it for themselves. That's theft. I know times are hard for a lot of us, but you didn't earn that money. I hope you're proud of yourself. Stay away from this Panera"

Sadly last night was unforgivable and I will not be returning.  My order for curbside was not ready after waiting for several minutes past the designated time so I entered and waited at the passthrough window.  The general state of the interior was unkempt and dirty.  The prep cooks wore their masks over their mouths but not their noses, frequently reaching up to adjust their masks or wipe their faces with gloved hands and then scooping their hands into salad materials or deli meats. While waiting I was casually informed they were out of bread (??) and I would be receiving chips with my soups and when the order was finally ready after getting into my car I realized the grilled cheese wasn't included in the bag.  Upon returning and informing the employees I was missing my grilled cheese they casually responded \"I know\" and handed me a crumpled wad of brown paper, presumably with the grilled cheese in it. Frankly this last issue was the wake up call I needed to realize this place is a health hazard.  I came to my senses and returned the food to the front counter, leaving empty handed.  Last night my family and I were all a little hungry but at least we weren't risking our health.\n\nIf the above review doesn't concern you and you would still like to patronize this place, please take my seasoned advice and always review your pickup order in full before leaving the store.  Nine times out of ten there is at least one missing or incorrect item."

I requested to speak to their manager who was flustered and left us feeling like we've caused him the greatest annoyance. We were served fixed meals but that's about it. No apology, no \"how can we make this better\" or \"how about refund for your bad experience\"? We left feeling like nobody really cared about their customers at this location. Not a good place to be; especially with wait staff frequently sleeping in patrons booths etc.\nManager could care less about his customers and appears to hate his job."

After we ordered and went to get our drinks a lady had already shut them all off an hour before they close. Pure eagerness to leave work. When our food was ready, one of our orders was incorrect and when we approached them to ask for new food the workers were in the back on facetime giggling. Very professional. Another food item we order came without it's salad dressing, and we were served with a plastic fork that broke, because they apparently didn't want to have to wash anymore silverware. Classy. The overall attitude, and presentation of the workers was poor, the chores that were being done should have occurred well after the restaurant was closed."
