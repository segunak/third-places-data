The flavor is balanced and thick.\n\nI was raised on banh mi.  Typically scour new places in Charlotte metro and other cities when travel.\n\nI ordered the cold cuts (special), grilled pork, pastries, and flan.  I was amazed of the bread/flavor/meat combination (good quality & value).  The bread, meat and sauce were actually hot, which is quite rare for my experience.  The dough is made in-house daily.  Really appreciate restaurants that specialize in one or two menu items and rock it.\n\nThere's flan and drinks.  Hopefully get to try \"bo kho\" and \"cari ga\" next time.  My new go-to banh mi place."

If you're in the mood for a coffee experience that makes you want to break into a happy dance, this is your spot. Their coffee is like a warm hug from your most caffeine-obsessed friend - perfectly brewed and packed with flavor.\n\nNow, onto the banh mi sandwiches. Picture this: crispy pork that's so crunchy, it's like a piggy orchestra playing a symphony in your mouth. The veggies? Fresh and crunchy enough to make a salad jealous. And don't even get me started on the bread - it's like they found the secret to baking clouds.\n\nBut it's not just about the food; the staff here could charm the socks off a snake. They're friendly, efficient, and they actually smile like they mean it. And here's the kicker - they have an app for ordering takeout that's so easy, even your technologically-challenged grandma could use it.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a place where the coffee flows like a river of liquid gold and the banh mi are a party in your mouth, 220degC is your new happy place. Trust me, you'll leave with a belly full of goodness and a heart full of joy. Five stars and a high-five to 220degC!\""

The taste of pistachio hit the spot. The sandwiches were freshly prepared with all the fresh ingredients, and the lemonade was wonderful as well.\n\nThe staff were kind and polite. The restroom in the back of the store was clean.\n\nI'll be back to try more of their drinks and food items. The bakery items on display looked delicious too!\n\nIt's in a strip mall, so there's a lot of parking available. I can't recommend this place enough."

Got the coffee and a tofu banh mi for breakfast. Both very good! I like the tofu at crispy banh mi slightly better, but this was still super good and had great bread. You can also buy the bread here, large single loaves. The viet hot coffee is the best I've had around Charlotte. Warm atmosphere and service. I think the lady was working by herself and she was still so kind and fast while it was getting busier around 930 Sunday. Nice seating area for groups or singles; cute table activities area for kids. Highly recommend!"

The bahn mi sandwich was light and tasty like it should be- loved the bulgogi one. The bread was beyond anything I've found locally. I can't say enough to express my delight with this place... a hidden gem in Matthews that you NEED to experience!!"

The bread had a really nice crunchy exterior and it was nice and soft on the inside. One thing that really stood out to me on this sandwich was the pickled daikon and carrots. They were a little more sweet and acidic than I have had from other places which I loved! The other ingredients were fresh and they made their bread in house which I appreciated.\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the Vietnamese iced coffee but this was just a preference thing. Nothing about it was bad, but I just don't have the palate for it. Mine also wasn't super sweet either, but I believe you can ask them to crank up the sweetness if you would like it to be sweeter.\n\nAs I was walking out, they were restocking their baked goods shelf, and I was able to snag a bulgogi beef bun! This made me so happy as I had wanted to try one of these after seeing photos of it from other reviews. The bread was super pillowy and the meat inside was extremely flavorful. Enjoying this bun was a great way to end this food experience, and I left happy and full."

The bread is crunchy on the outside, soft and light on the inside. It's a perfect sandwich.\n\nThank you thank you thank you for opening up here!

Super fresh, exterior is crispy and the interior is soft.  I've tried 5 of the 8 sandwiches so far, and I've realized that I would eat literally anything they put between their bread. The pastries and coffee are good as well.\n\nThey're a new business and a small operation, so I'm sure they may experience some bumps in the road, but based on their level of service and quality of food they'll be around for the long haul (at least I hope so for my stomach's sake)!"

Crispy but soft bread, tender seasoned meat, delicious pickles. So happy we live close by. Did not try the coffee yet, but the clerk in the shop next door told me it's very good. I'll go back soon for another sandwich and a strong, sweet Vietnamese coffee. There are many other coffees and also baked goods on the menu."
