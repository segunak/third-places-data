While we were waiting, he was huffing and puffing and glaring at us, and I felt as if I was somehow intruding when all I wanted was to pick up my drink. We never spoke to him or interacted in anyway, but I just felt the animosity coming off of him. Maybe he was having a bad day but when you're making the drinks out in public, it's probably best not to glare at the Customers. There are many choices in this area and I definitely will choose someplace else next time."
