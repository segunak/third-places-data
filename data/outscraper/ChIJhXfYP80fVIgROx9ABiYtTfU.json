I carry my own wipes into the library and wipe down the keyboard and mouse for my own protection. I hope they can start offering these things in the future. I have even asked for a wipe before and was given one. Amazing staff there and I would recommend this library to all. Happy Holidays and best wishes for the New Year!"
