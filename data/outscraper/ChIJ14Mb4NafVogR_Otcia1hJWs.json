Coffee was diluted and didn't taste like coffee at all.\nNothing had been heated up or even offered to be done that way, even Starbucks offers it. They replied to other customer in reviews that they should request it, i would say it's business responsibility offer it to appeal the customer.\nOverall just another bakery in CLT, there are one in Camp North End that just as good and definitely in need of community support, her owner even was on a local news."

I ordered the croissant with bacon egg and cheese, the chocolate croissant, the Kouign Amann, the spinach and feta croissant and the blue berry danish.

I personally observed a carafe of mixed egg that was presumably used for something else other than making me and selling me what I asked for.\n\nOn a weekend, this hardline cutoff at 11:00 seems arbitrary and petty. I gently gave them another opportunity to say \"yeah we can make an exception,\" but was unsuccessful.\n\nTheir items are delicious, but I'm inclined to not return in principle, and find another bakery that also makes delicious things, and also recognizes that maybe it's beneficial to sell a customer something they highly desire and have an unlimited willingness to pay."
