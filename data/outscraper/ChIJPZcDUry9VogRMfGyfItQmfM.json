It's in what appears to a residential area, so look closely! We are glad we did! We ended up coming here every morning except for the morning we left for home. The coffee is outstanding. Starbucks and other national brands pale in comparison. Perfect medium roast flavor, not too weak or strong. The only critique would be the mocha frappe. Not enough milk/chocolate relative to the amount of the espresso shot. Maybe they should do some more taste testing to then standardize the amounts of the ingredients. We asked for one more pump of chocolate, which was happily given. Much better afterward. A little more milk would have been the bomb! Next time we are in the area we will be visiting again!"

Great to chill.\nThe espresso is Night Swim, and it's solid, high quality and Wandering Cup represents them well.\nThey also use Treeline Coffee Roasters from Montana, which may be my new best cup.\nIt's at least top 3 out of the 50+ premier roasters I've had in the last 4 years from around the world.\nI had their Paradise Valley roast as a pour over and it nailed the fruity light finish I love in a good cup.\nI will definitely be back and can't recommend this coffee shop enough."

I had a golden chai, it was nice - but again, it wasn't overly hot, so after it cooled off I didn't drink it.\nI did like the pastry selection that they had, we didn't purchase anything but they looked great with lots of vegan and gluten free options.\nThere isn't a lot of seating options inside, we were able to find a spot but this seems odd for a coffee shop. I always like to drink my coffee and take in the atmosphere, but that's just me.

These are both places I love. Our most recent trip was because Honeybear was doing a pop-up.\n\nIn addition to our cookies, we decided to get a drink. I wanted to try a golden chai since I've never had one, but then I saw the seasonal drinks. I had to try the Tinsel Tea.\n\nThey steep the tea in apple cider instead of water (and then add things like cranberry I think). All tea should be made like this. It was delicious!\n\nWe'll be back for a golden chai at some point. Check them out if you're in the area!"

Even as a non-coffee drinker I found the tea to be refreshing! The owner really has heart behind all things at this spot. The story and passion behind the Wandering Cup makes it such a jewel."
