There is only 2 things I would want others to know: the parking is not great. I'm not sure if we went at a busier time than normal but had to park in front of someone's house down the street. And they are a cashless business so be sure to have a debit/credit card handy! All in all, great little shop with a great selection!"

My fiance was with me for the first time during this visit. He always ask a lot of random questions when he's fascinated about something. He was admiring the shop. We were there the last hour before closing. One member of the staff, was a little rude to us and made us feel like she was annoyed of us during my checkout because my fiance asked a random question. The owner, who is ALWAYS amazing to me, wasn't there. I've been feeling a little bothered about the interaction with the staff since. I asked my fiance if he felt the same or if I was just crazy, and he agreed that he felt like she was rude."

Bear in mind that there is little to no parking at this location. There is literally only 5 parking spots and one handicap spot out of the 5 parking spots available. It is a quaint, but cozy space filled with books and everything is well labeled.There is shelves dedicated to various romance subgenres. There is Dark romance, Fantasy romance, Monster romance, Mafia romance etc. The people tending to the store were super friendly, and I asked what the process is for local authors to have their book in the store. They highly recommend emailing them, and you will discuss with the owner where to go from there. I love this store and I would definitely go back"

Some of my best friends are published authors and I get a real thrill out of proof or beta reading a new manuscript before it is refined and polished. How does that relate to this newly opened, woman owned, brick and mortar shop here in Central Charlotte you might ask? Well the answer is quite simple before you can get lost in a book, you first must find it. At the Trope Bookstore they have an excellent selection of One Genre. A specialized bookstore if you will. I mean I shop at specialized shops all the time, so why not go to a curated place where the staff are extremely knowledgeable on practically every book on the shelves!\nI don't know why you're still reading this when you should be reading the spines of the books at Trope! Get going!!\nBy the way I'd like to mention this one book I saw, and I'm pretty sure no one knows quite what the contents of it are supposed to be? \"You're A Violent Little Thing Aren't' You\"\nGo find it!"
