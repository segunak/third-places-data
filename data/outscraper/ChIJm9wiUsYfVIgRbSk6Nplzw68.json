Some of my best friends are published authors and I get a real thrill out of proof or beta reading a new manuscript before it is refined and polished. How does that relate to this newly opened, woman owned, brick and mortar shop here in Central Charlotte you might ask? Well the answer is quite simple before you can get lost in a book, you first must find it. At the Trope Bookstore they have an excellent selection of One Genre. A specialized bookstore if you will. I mean I shop at specialized shops all the time, so why not go to a curated place where the staff are extremely knowledgeable on practically every book on the shelves!\nI don't know why you're still reading this when you should be reading the spines of the books at Trope! Get going!!\nBy the way I'd like to mention this one book I saw, and I'm pretty sure no one knows quite what the contents of it are supposed to be? \"You're A Violent Little Thing Aren't' You\"\nGo find it!"
