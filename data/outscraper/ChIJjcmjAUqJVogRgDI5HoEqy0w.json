This place was a lovely accidental find that my momma and I will now always come to when we come to work in Rock Hill.\nThe display is laid out with exquisite desserts that not only look beautiful but taste perfect as well. I am a Baker myself, and I love how traditional they are with their French pastries!\nThe coffee my momma had was the best she had ever tasted (it was a well-balanced mocha).\nWe ordered 4 items (expensive, but once you taste, you'll understand the quality you are paying for)\nThe strawberry mousse cake was delicious, and the strawberries were fresh and tasty\nThe apple pear domed tartlet was gorgeous with the lavender petals. The flavors blended very well together and were not too sweet like other places\nThe chocolate and caramel tartlet was rich and smooth\nThe favorite of the 4 items was the peris brest! I was in heaven and absolutely took my mind somewhere while eating it, and I was nothing but smiles.\nThank you so much for the quality of your pastries and the service you gave us with such a warm smile. We can not wait to come back."

Not to mention they're French-African I knew right away it'd be good and it really was.\n\nUnfortunately we didn't take any pictures of the tart we got but it was the nectarine tart and the date mousse cake. When I tell you the dessert were not sweet it is definitely a compliment. They have the right taste to it especially the nectarine one. You'd feel fruity taste in the tart and it's not overwhelmed by the sugar.\n\nFor the canele, they're the right size and the caramel crust they have on it is so perfect. From what I've had over here no other bakeries can bake it the same as they do. No other places can make the crust as crunchy as them. I'm loving every bite I take.\n\nWe'd definitely come back earlier because we were here very late and they ran out of some good pastry and cakes. We'll also try their coffee and chai tea next time!"

They were out of most pastries, but managed to buy 2 croissants, 2 choux (cream puffs), 2 madeleines, & a latte.  The madeleines were heavenly.  Sorry no photo. The croissants were perfect. The choux was different, but the pistachio cream was addictive.  I wish there were more to buy. Service was friendly.  She even spoke French to the guy making my latte.  Cool bank vault door to the lounge. Very cool."

We visit France twice a year so we do know what fresh french baguettes and pastries should taste like but unfortunately we didn't find them here.  We arrived when they open at 8:30am but the croissants and baguettes were not yet ready to come out of the oven.  When the baguette was finally ready, it was nice and warm but was not as light and airy in the middle as we expect from a good baguette.  The baguette crust was good but just a bit too dense inside and at $5 for a small baguette, is five times more expensive than what you would get at a French boulangerie.\n\nAlso tried their madelines which were quite tasty with nice crunchy edges and ordered a bacon quiche which was tasty but not exceptional.  Also ordered capuccinos which were good."

When I found Mado bakery  online and look at the pictures, I could already see that everything would taste exactly like the pastries that I'll find in Bordeaux. And I was right, the macaroons are delicious,  the best I have tested in the US and at the same level that the ones I used to eat back home. The choux  pastries are unreal and show to me that the owners have the French savoir faire. If you want real authentic French  << boulangerie >> style pastries then you have to go there only.

We usually come on Sundays to end the week on a relaxing and tasty note. The owners are very friendly, and it could not be more obvious that they have a passion for all they do and make there. They take the time to explain all the new items, of which there are everytime we go in, and to give recommendations. The menu is so varied each time we go, giving us a new experience each time- and yes there are some staple choices for those who like a little more routine. This place is a little slice of heaven, just like their treats. If you have a super busy lifestyle, or are in the slumps, this is the kind of place you make time for. When I say their coffee is incomparable, I mean it. You will not find another cafe nor a bakery of this quality anywhere near this area. If I could give 10 stars, I would."

LOVELY ladies in there. My friend mentioned it was my birthday and they gave me a little chocolate cake and said happy birthday! How very sweet! How on earth they got so much chocolate into one tiny cake is beyond me! The pastries were scrummy too. I don't go to Ware often but when I do I will definitely pay a return visit. Easily 5 stars from me. What a darling little place :)"

This family owned business is classically trained in baking pastries and other baked goods and the fact that they go the extra effort to import French flour makes all of the difference. The cafe is delicious as well. Go for the espresso or americano for a more authentic experience. Drip coffee is an acquired american taste."
