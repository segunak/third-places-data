My only suggestion for the food shops is to offer more drink options aside from alcohol, beer, and canned sodas or bottled water, some fresh juices or lemonades would have been great!"

We had to put a bunch of napkins down and then place our food on their plates.\n\nWe were sitting in front of Thai Esane restaurant and there was a worker that had gloves on serving people.  That was great, but then when people walked away he was touching his hair with the gloves on and then took a napkin and wiped his nose.  Again his gloves were still on!   So apparently, he was serving people with the same gloves.  So, that was really unhygienic and we will not be back to visit this market to eat."

Seen numerous dogs in bags, or just people bringing in large dogs.\n\nNo outside food allowed but I watched a family bring an entire large pizza in from another establishment with other items and sit down and eat.\n\nCleaning leaves a lot to be desired all over as garbage is frequently over flowing. Cleaners drink on the job too as you can see one of them with a cup of beer in their hands multiple times a shift.\n\nConcrete is dirty, flower beds and mulch is filled with trash, brick hasn't been power washed/cleaned etc. no care given to the exterior of the building.\n\nAlways hot inside, air conditioning doesn't seem to work correctly or efficiently given it's a new build and the units should be new.\n\nNot enough parking for anybody. A parking ramp is desperately needed. You only need two floors max to have enough space or expand the parking lot asap.\n\nCookies are the best thing there but I heard they are being run out soon for another business. So hopefully someone steps their quality up!"

Hope was an excellent server.  We played cards at her table since it wasn't very busy but we left her an extra $20 in tip to make up for monopolizing the table for almost two hours.  We moved downstairs for the second half of girls night out.  Beer selection was excellent according to my friends."

You can pay per player for a table and get to play any board game or work any puzzle available on the shelves (think like a coffee shop-style bookstore) OR you can purchase new games, puzzles, or gaming accessories in their retail space.

The execution leaves way too much to be desired.\n\nThe complex is a redevelopment of an old mill/factory. You enter the \"market\" by way of a bridge from the antique mall part of the complex.\nThere are 6-7 eateries/bar/desert shops within a large building. Hence the market moniker. The bar seems to do a good business.\n\nWe walked around looking at the various restaurants... taco place (taco street)- staff was sitting and leaning on the counters - No customers. Pass. Next was a burger and BBQ place (Johnny Rogers) couple of people eating here and it looked ok. So we decided to try. Asked the counter girl which was her favorite the BBQ or the burger. She said she didn't really like either.  Hmm should have taken that advice.  However I ordered the BBQ with fries.  Not good. $33 and I threw mine in the trash. Super heavy clove spice.  Just heavy ughh food. The oil the fries were cooked in probably had not been changed in three weeks...yuck. Just garbage.\n\nThere is a pizza place, and Indian restaurant, an ice cream shop, cookie shop and coffee shop.\n\nWe did get a chocolate chip cookie for $5. It was ok. Consistency of a doughy dense slightly undercooked.  It was ok.\n\nReally wish we had not eaten here."

Chili cheese fries from another place that were awesome! A great portion for a great price. Would go back for those. And a taco from another place that was overflowing with steak. I'd be back, although I didn't care for their chimichurri. It felt too large of a cut to be a sauce and it was a weird flavor to me. The cookie place and icecream places were both not opening until 4 so that was a bummer. Had we not had the babies we would've checked out the arcade. Overall great experience though."
