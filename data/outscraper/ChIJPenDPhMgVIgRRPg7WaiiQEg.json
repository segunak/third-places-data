            "review_text": "This is connected to ReStore (a place run by Habitats for Humanity) where people can donate furniture and other home items. (Great if you enjoy thrifting. )\n\nAlthough the cafe appears to be a separate business from ReStore - they have their own set of donated products that they also sell - I noticed books, records/vinyls, sheet music, and cute note cards. The products displayed in the cafe are specifically sold in the cafe and must be purchased there (as well as the food/drinks, of course). And vice versa for the products displayed in the ReStore area.\n\nWhile they are separate businesses with separate checkout areas, however, they are really part of one big warehouse and customers can easily go in and out of the cafe and ReStore without going outside to exit one and enter the other. Because of that, I suspect that they are both run by Habitat for Humanity, and I'd also imagine the proceeds from both help the same cause.\n\nThe people that were working there were really nice, too! I enjoyed talking with them, and they seemed genuinely interested in our conversation.\n\nEven the other customers were nice, lol. My mom and I were singing a song from sheet music, trying to remember exactly how the song went. (Obnoxious to do in public, I know... ) But these two ladies sitting near us said they enjoyed our earlier singing as they were leaving the cafe. \n\nI'm attaching a picture of the things I bought (for next to nothing!) so people can get idea of the products sold in the cafe area.

Yet, this was much more than a cafe (see pictures of food, books, and movies)!\n\nThe staff, like most Habitat locations, was very friendly and helpful. I learned that in the Charlotte area alone, Julia's cafe receives thousands of books each year which every folks can buy for as little as $1. But they have a special section set aside of rare books. Those books will cost a little more, yet nothing outrageous.\n\nNow, they also have movies for sale which looked brand new and perfect for cold days like we have coming up. On the way in or out, don't forget to grab a drink or pastry which looked amazing.\n\nI would definitely recommend stopping by!"

And with sales benefiting a charitable cause as well.\n\nThe coffee and food selection seems quite broad, and they have different types of cow and plant milk for your dietary desires. My latte arrived hot and tasty, and allowed me to with warm hands!\n\nWith my coffee I perused the book selection, and it's quite diverse, from children's books to vintage book, even bibles and nutrition options to choose from. I needed up grabbing a vintage historical fiction novel I hope to enjoy from 1945 and in great condition!\n\nDefinitely a great place to browse, and if you have kids or are in need of childrens books, there are tons at very affordable prices."

If you're an espresso or redeye coffee kid like me...their dark blends are awesome! They do have Tea and \"frufru drinks\" both hot and cold. If you can answer the trivia question you get a very small discount BUT you might just walk away with some off the wall knowledge that you didn't already know! The staff is great and ... remember some are also volunteers. Donate your books...Help our community and learn something new for the day...ENJOY!"
