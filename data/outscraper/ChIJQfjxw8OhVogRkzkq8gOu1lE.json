I went to order a salad on Rhino Market's website through GrubHub. There was an error with the ordering system (it required me to choose an extra dressing for a fee, which I didn't need/want) so I decided to just order in person. When I got in, there was no one else ordering or waiting. I placed my order, which the girl taking the order didn't seem familiar with. She didn't write my complete order on the ticket. I had to offer what dressing I'd like. While waiting for my pollo salad with chicken salad on top, I perused the aisles. Super cute local products as well as kitchen staples and snacks for sale. A large beer selection. I picked a couple of things and paid, then waited for my food. My salad took twenty minutes to be ready, and when it was ready it was missing the chicken salad. Just a plain salad, 20 mins wait on a Friday morning. Although I can't figure out the wait time, I honestly don't believe the missing chicken salad was the cooking staff's fault, because the ticket was incomplete. He graciously apologized and fixed it for me.\n\nIt wasn't until I got back to my vehicle and viewed my receipt that I decided to write this review.\n\n**DO NOT ORDER THROUGH GRUBHUB from Rhino Deli unless you are prepared to pay an additional undisclosed 55% markup on the food here.** I was blown away when I realized I paid $8.99 for a salad that was $13.63 before fees and taxes to order online. I find this to be a shady business practice and believe it should at the very least be disclosed conspicuously on the business's website. While they may pay a fee to use GrubHub, a 56% markup per item is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nThe salad and chicken salad were just okay.\n\nI love to give small local businesses my money, and I work a few blocks away. I'll never be back."

Well the rude white man told me with a frown on his face that there's a line. I didn't know line's were formed in between the isles so I get in line and the white man is frowning his face discussing me. How unprofessional is this business. I pay go to the back to get my food and, I'm standing there waiting for my food. All the time your non greeting person just looked at me and, talking with coworkers. After about 10 minutes of looking at me she finally told me that my food was in another window. Took one bite and, totally disgusted me.

I purposely ordered what I thought would be a easy item, a muffin with egg, havarti and sausage.  My number was 24...  after 20 min, they were calling numbers after mine, large orders, 5-6 items.  After 30 min they were calling numbers in the 30's. I asked deli staff and was told \"it's on its way.  We are 20 min behind. \" well after 40 minutes  \"number 24\".  I went outside to eat with my now empty coffee cup.  Muffin had no sausage.\nDisappointed."

It's a great addition to the NoDa/Villa Heights area, as we were missing a good sandwich shop. The staff is always super nice and they are part of the bicycle discount places across town. Buy a sticker for $5 from any location (Birdsong is also part of this program) and you get discounts whenever you ride your bike to these places and show your helmet with the sticker on it.\n\nI especially love their sandwiches and that they have gluten free bread that I can pair with their vegan sandwiches. We've never had a bad experience at Rhino Market. The vibe is relaxed and I love their patio on a sunny day. Definitely a highlight in the NoDa/Villa Heights area!"
