As for me, I think I got the cloud nine espresso drink. It was Good balance of sweetness and coffee flavor with the right amount of foam. The our only thing was it was a little cooler than I like for a hot drink but didn't deter. Now the muffins were wonderful, I got a cinnamon muffin and a chocolate chip muffins. Both had wonderful flavor both, the cinnamon had a good balance of sweetness and  cinnamon flavor. The chocolate chip muffin had just the right amount of chocolate chips to muffin ratio. Both were really moist with a perfect outer crust. I would highly recommend this place for coffee and muffins. The gentleman behind the counter was nice and polite and efficient."

We waited a few weeks and thought we should give it another chance just to be fair.  They have a big sign over the counter with menu and prices.  You can build your own sandwich for $10.50.  It lists the different sandwich items and breads, one of which is a croissant.  The price we were charged was $10.87 per sandwich plus $2.33 each for the croissants.  They no longer bake every day so the croissants were not fresh.  They also had no diet soft drinks of any kind.  Since the old owners left it has gone down considerably.  When I asked about the differences in the prices and the additional cost for the croissants I was told that is the way they do it now.  No apology of any kind.  I have never written a business a bad review of any kind so this cannot be written of to me just being a complainer.  I am just the opposite.  We will not be back."

This cake was phenomenal. The filling is spot on and not too sweet, just perfect. The cake altogether was absolutely delicious. Their 6 inch round was about 50 bucks but you actually get a lot of cake for that. Staff was so so friendly and super helpful (phone and counter). Only suggestion is to have more staff on hand on Saturdays. We picked up at noon on a Saturday and there seemed to only be one person working at the counter. She was lovely but it took a while to pick up. Will definitely be back and recommend to others!"

Prices are reasonable. When compared to Starbucks, this place is more worth it.\nThe customer service is good. Only thing though is that it is slow because there are usually only 2 people working at the front at a time.\nSide note: please try the lox bagel !

            "review_text": "Let me start with the positive - - Their baked goods are great. Great tasting, and generously sized. Their coffee drinks are decent. Location is very convenient. Fantastic hours.\n\nNow the negatives.. Overall unfriendly vibe.  I'm not saying the employees are rude, but for the most part they are typically not very friendly and seem inconvenienced by waiting on you to make a decision, even if you just walked in the door. Not to mention the off putting signs everywhere. \"Bathrooms for customers only\". Seriously? You're located in a tiny shopping center with a bank and a dance studio, how much foot traffic could you possibly be getting that is going to use your toilet and not buy something?? Just seems tacky and cheap.\n\nMy biggest stink is their 40 Cent transaction fee for purchases under 5 dollars. I am familiar with merchant fees charged my Visa, MC, Amex & Discover. Even on a 5 dollar purchase at a merchant charge of 5% of the purchase only comes out to .25 cents (15 Cent surplus). So they are blindly charging a random number and profiting on the rest.(Fees are much closer to 2% and 3%). 3% on 5 dollars is 15 cents. That is a 25 cent profit on every transaction under 5 dollars. A purchase under $5 is pretty easy to do if you just want a coffee or a muffin. Now am I really bothered by a 40 cent charge added to my 5 dollar coffee? No, not really. But the principle of this is wrong. Charging your customers an additional fee for trying to pay? That screams \"struggling business\". It's the 21st century, Many people don't pay with cash, as paying with a bank card is far more convenient. If you want the business, bite the bullet and pay the transaction fee.\n\nMy advice? If a business is in the red over a matter of 40 cents and having people use their water by flushing their toilets, they probably shouldn't be in business."

They have a TV and even toys for kids to play so if you decide to go for coffee and want to bring your kids. They have some really cool mugs for sale to check out while you are the there.\n\nThe coffee\n\nI ordered the Iced Almond Roca latte which was very good.  It had great flavor with a good balance of sweet yet able to taste the coffee. They also have a nice selection of desserts. I trusted the guy and went with a the Turtle brownie and my wife had the lemon butter tart. Both had great flavor were good choices.  If you are looking for a great non Starbucks coffee shop that you can bring your kids and has great hours you need to check this place out!"
