I've been here several times, including today, when the soda machine didn't work and 50% of time time the floor around the lemonade/tea and soda machine has standing water on it with no wet floor sign or is VERY sticky. The staff today wasn't even at the counter so i just ordered my drink at the kiosk, and grabbed a cup from behind the counter. Today was the 2nd or 3rd time that I've beeen here and the wifi has been down so I'm hotspotting my phone. For reference, I've been coming to this location for about 14 months. I'll find somewhere else to meet clients for coffee, knock out emails, and grab brunch after church from now on."

His genuine concern for my health and safety was evident as he proactively inquired about my dietary needs. I was immediately put at ease by his knowledge and understanding of gluten allergies, knowing that I was in capable hands.\n\nThroughout the ordering process, Alex proved to be an invaluable resource. He guided me through the menu, highlighting the gluten-free options available and offering valuable recommendations. His thorough understanding of Panera's ingredients and food preparation procedures showcased his exceptional expertise in catering to individuals with dietary restrictions.\n\nWhat truly distinguished Alex was his meticulous attention to detail and dedication to preventing cross-contamination. He took the time to explain the potential risks involved and shared Panera's stringent protocols for maintaining a gluten-free environment. His commitment to ensuring my safety was both admirable and reassuring.\n\nWhen it came time to place my order, Alex's expertise shone through. He patiently walked me through the customization options, carefully selecting ingredients and ensuring that my meal would be completely free from gluten. I felt valued and supported throughout the entire process, knowing that Alex genuinely cared about my well-being.\n\nThe outcome was a delectable and worry-free meal that exceeded my expectations.

I waited a total of 40 minutes and after not seeing the order I asked for a refund because by that point I had to get back to work. But even the manager told me she couldn't give me a refund because it had to be done online and she said it won't be done until the next day.. so I paid $25 for food I didn't get. I was late to work going back from lunch and I am starving.. I would rate this experience in the negatives if I could"

The manager insisted it's invalid and bought from a 3rd party therefore it's invalid. I've never heard anything like this before and I believe she didn't want to do it manually like the instructions said or she didn't know how to do it. Later on I called the 800 # of Panera to check balance and after I typed in the card # it showed me the balance of $15.

I saw there are older reviews about customer service and my only guess is that this may have been during the height of the pandemic. Every restaurant has had a tough time with staffing and I have learned to be patient and especially to be kind to those that are now taking on multiple positions at one job.\nI have only had great experiences at the Sharon Amity location. The staff are super friendly and always get my custom order correct...okay, maybe one or twice it wasn't perfect but that is why I check my bag before I leave, even Chick-Fil-A gets my order wrong most of the time and I rarely go there.\nAnother point I would like to make: The NC minimum wage is only $7.25 per hour. Granted I have no idea what Panera pays but still it is not $100K a year so please be kind to people in the service industry. They are working hard to serve YOU. Jumping down off my soap box. Have a great day!"

Me the signature chicken sandwich and my wife a Ceasars salad. After a short wait I was presented with a sandwich that appeared to be made in about 5 seconds. The sauce was so minimal I could hardly taste it, and the chicken? Cold to medium warm, looked like it was under the heat lights for the last 2 hours  and so dry it was almost inedible. Huge disappointment. I'll be back when everyone on the planet runs out of bagels."

My girlfriends salad nothing but chicken and iceberg lettuce and 2 tomatoes no dressing etc... Tried to call to inform them three times no answer.

Now I don't about anyone else but that's a nope for me if it's a fruit cup. Called back and was made aware they have always done it this way. So, I'm guessing I was wanting to much to have my fruit in another bag(separate). When I asked the young lady said it just as it was placed in the bag. So I just wanted to say Thank You Panera for MY HOT FRUIT CUP!! (never again)"

I should have walked out then, but, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There was one staff working the register and another who seemed to be doing support stuff - cleaning buzzers. She had to be told to help with the busy, almost out the door line, by grabbing the pastry items for orders. No manager ever surfaced to the register area, even when the line was quite long.\nI ordered 6 bagels, split and a tub of cream cheese to go; a pepperoni pizza and a turkey bravo w/ a fruit cup; kitchen sink cookie and a brownie.\nThe floor was sticky (thinking the stench was the fact that the floor was probably mopped the night before with dirty water that had sat all day), and it took about a 1/2 hour to get our food - dine in. I'd understand if it were lunch time, but it was after 1pm.\nDid I mention the floor was sticky? The whole floor. I walked from the front register to a table in the back by a window. Even the carpet was sticky. The restrooms needed a good cleaning as well.\nI had to go back to the front counter to get my bagels and cream cheese and noticed then that there were gnats in the bakery area. The line was still quite long and it was filling up in the dining area because people were waiting for their orders.\nAll the one worker did was get bakery items, so, not sure how it took her 15 minutes to split 6 bagels, but it did. SMH\nThe food counter: there was a worker standing outside the counter to hand people their orders. Umm, he would have been used much more efficiently in prepping the orders. It was a major manager fail to have him standing there doing nothing in between orders.\nThe food: I ordered a pepperoni pizza w/ onions. I know that they have raw onions. Did they put raw onions on my pizza? Nope. Made too much sense. Pickled red onions were placed on my pizza. Disgusting to say the least.\nI didn't want to go through returning because it was already a hot mess. I watched a couple of people go get their money back and leave. I should have followed suit.\nThis location needs a lot of help, starting w/ a 24 hour shut down to totally clean and sanitize. Followed very closely by a new manager and staff who will understand what teamwork means."

The summer corn chowder did not seem fresh; it tasted like last night's soup. Now let's talk about the fruit. Why did Panera Bread serve me a rotten apple? Is that healthy, fresh and clean? I can see the brown circles all over the apple.  And my lemonde expires on Wednesday, May 1, 2019. Is that healthy and clean? Please let me know about that."

Good coffee and bread offerings, but over time, was more and more dissatisfied with the food quality, and impersonal service, so I mostly stopped visiting.  Tried them again today for the first time in years.  Same Panera, same dissatisfaction.  Purchase overpriced food, wait until it's cold before it reaches your table (or walk up and get it myself while it's still hot), eat in cramped surroundings, take your dishes up to a dish station yourself.   You even get to clean your own table before eating.  (What service did I pay for that would warrant adding a tip to the purchase checkout screen?)   Ordered a 4 cheese croissant, which was served barely warm.  When I asked the staff member if they could heat it (in an oven or toaster) she pointed to the microwave and said I could do it myself.  Nothing like the taste of microwaved pastry... soggy and unevenly heated.  I also ordered a cafe mocha, and after the first taste, remembered why I go to Starbucks so often.  The coffee was warm not hot, drenched in a chocolate syrup that gave an almost medicinally sweet taste.  The whipped cream had mostly dissolved because it sat on the serving counter too long."
