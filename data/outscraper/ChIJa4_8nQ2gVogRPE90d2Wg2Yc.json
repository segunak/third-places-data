This was my first time coming to the newer location, and I must say that I definitely enjoyed this location better than the last location they were previously. This space is much bigger and more organized, I feel. It didn't feel so cramped. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with a bar and then a couch where you can play games on PS4 or Xbox. We played a few rounds of Mario Kart and loved it! There are some stairs that lead you down to the arcade. You have to purchase tokens to be able to play the games. The games only require either 1 or 2 tokens each, so you will definitely get your money's worth. They even have a few games that are \"free play,\" which basically means it's free, and you just hop on and start playing. Came on a Saturday night around 8 pm, and it was not busy yet. They have parking around the building, but if it gets full, they do have free parking across the street on an empty lot. They did have a taco truck right outside, and you could order food and bring it inside and eat. They do have 2 tables you can sit at and enjoy your drinks and food. Overall, it was a great experience and will return. It is a great place to bring kids during the weekend from 12-6pm."

Almost all games are 1 or 2 quarters (pinball is 2). A few of the older games are on free play (Burgertime for example). Took over an hour for me to go through $10.\n\nPlenty of parking on Saturday afternoon in the lot directly across the street. Place was busy at 2 but not \"crowded\". On Saturday afternoon there was a large mix of parents waiting upstairs while their kids played downstairs, dads playing with their kids, 20s on their own, and 40s reliving their memories."

Just ask the bartender for $5 in tokens.\n\nThe biggest perk is that during the weekend says kids are welcome!

Lots of classic arcade, shooting, and music games. 37 pinball machines in good condition including Indiana Jones, Halloween, Willy Wonka, Creature from the Black Lagoon and Stranger Things. While I was there (on a Saturday night) not a single pinball machine was out of service. The place is open till 2am like a true bar, and offers liquor in addition to beer and nonalcoholic beverages. Reasonable drink prices, particularly for canned drinks. Super Abari is almost exclusively 21+ with the exception of noon to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. They have a nice fenced-in patio outside for smoking and taking a break outdoors. No cover fee, just coin op, 50 Cents a game. No real food but a nice vending machine inside for a mild snack. Friendly and courteous staff. Customers there seem relaxed, chill and respectful. This place is hosting the 2023 NC State Pinball Championship and it shows. If you're interested in an arcade bar or just a bar to play games at, this place is gold. Highly recommend."

The drinks I didn't care for much even though they had cool names. They're not worth $15 each for a small plastic cup. I don't think they have food so if they don't they should definitely have some munchies. Parking can be tight even with the additional parking across the street.\nGo to Optimist Hall for dinner and then hit Abari for a nice date night ;)"

Be careful because you can burn through a lot of cash very quickly.\n\nI went with my two kiddos, ages 9 and 2.5. The 9 year old loved it. The place was definitely not geared for toddlers, but we made do (he enjoyed putting the quarters into the slots more the than games themselves).\n\nNote to parents: I *think* kids are only allowed between 12-5pm on weekends, although I'm not sure. That's why I was trying to call them to verify, but...secret society (see above)."

You also have a giant Game Boy as soon as you walk in and is completely playable. I'd say the only downside if there is one is that there's no food on the premises. I don't know if it's because we're in NC, but so far every barcade I've visited after moving to the area does not offer food. Other than that, I'd highly recommend it and if you're a fan of fighting games you'll most likely find me there trying to rack up the wins with one quarter "

They had gaming groups and some folks rocking alone. Saw all sorts of games. My fav is the oversized Gameboy upstairs... but what took my heart was the Alf stuffed animal in the machine. Took me back! The outside patio was nice and the string lights make it fun.\n\nSadly- I came out there bc my sister was being followed by another guest she didn't know. I didn't want her to feel unsafe. When I arrived I found her on the patio still being harassed.  I then intervened by asking him to step away and not come near us. He then took convo up with other guests in the corner. We left soon after. She expressed she would not be returning after finding out he frequents the space due to his \"living\" situation. She is an avid gamer and was looking forward to supporting the gaming crew she is apart of and the relocation to this new amazing space- but she doesn't want to be targeted either. I encouraged her to speak up and tell management if it occurred again. Unfortunately I didn't see any security if there was any present."

As a result a lot of old reviews incorrectly got ported over. I once said Paranoia Pinball was the only correct spot in Charlotte to play pinball (and is still my preference), but this place is now up there as well. Walking down the stairs and seeing the old tvs playing 80s scenes and hearing and seeing all the games was definitely a portal into the past. There was parking at the building and overflow parking across the street, as Saturday evening was ramping up people were playing Tetris to park. The crowd felt more \"Instagram\" than \"Basement dweller\" but that might change as the newness of the place wears off. Plenty of .50 cent pinball. They actually had a pinball tournament going on. The grand champion scores on machines attest that the machines have been played by serious players. Bar served drinks and food, not too impressed with the draft beer selection or the size of the bar, but it was tolerable. Overall it was a good experience and I'm happy to see more pinball in Charlotte.\n\nEdit: Another thing I forgot to mention is that this place is open all the time, even on most holidays it seems, up until 2 am! It's nice to finally have a retrocade that is open on the \"slower\" days, when everywhere else is closed. I stayed until close on Sunday and I noticed the staff were taking the time to clean the pinball glass, which was a nice attention to detail. Staff have always been very friendly."

We drove over an hour for the let down, went to The Basement Arcade Bar and was welcomed with open arms! I gave The Basement Arcade Bar 5 stars, and yes Abari, they are a members only bar too. Unless you're looking for trouble don't go to this place, you can tell by the door man that it's a druggie infested hangout, they were right, no place for a 13 year old, or a 37 year old man for that matter!"
