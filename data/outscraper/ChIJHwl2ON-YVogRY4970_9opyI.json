She wasn't, she was talking to someone on the phone through her headphones. This is the first face you see when you walk in and she was on the phone talking. Unbelievable! That's not all. I came back to the front to grab a sweet before I left (the cookies are my favorite) and this same cashier was on what seemed to be a personal tablet. At the register, where everyone could see!! I don't think she even saw me because she was so focused on her tablet. I also noticed as I was eating that people would have to wait on her as she would step away from the register for long periods of time. Again, I didn't get a name because she didn't have a name tag on but I dined in today around 6pm. Everyone else on the staff was helpful and the food was delicious. It's sad how one employee can almost ruin the whole experience. I hope this employee is handled for a better future experience!"

When we walked in there was a line but the cashier seem to be just standing there. No smile, no greeting, nothing.  We decided to order from the kiosk which was easy to navigate. Once we placed our order I waited to hear my name to be called. There were several people standing at the pick up window so I stood with them waiting. The kitchen was very busy but well run by a gentleman with a beard. He was putting orders up as they were being made. Sadly he had to stop what he was doing to tell the cashier to stop standing around and clean tables on her down time. She pushed through the crowd without saying anything and the look on her face made it seem like she did not want to work there. She just stood at the pick up window tapping her finger nails on the counter. A few people approached and tried to ask her a question, she just shrugged and said she didn't know. Look, if you hate your job, I get it but at least act polite to your customers. Big shout out to the kitchen staff for being hit with 2 teams and still getting orders out. Our food was awesome and correct."

The only critique I have is that depending who is working the drive thru: your iced or hot coffee will either be mixed for you with your cream and sugar etc ready to go in your car... or you will be handed a palm full of stuff and a full coffee cup. This is not conducive to tidy cars with no where to cleanly discard used packets of sugar or cream cups with no bag for trash since you only ordered a cup. Or if there is no room in your cup for add ins you have to find a way to pour some out. It would be nice to have a standard of mixing the coffee before it goes through the window - or at least consistently not mixing it so I know what I'm signing up for instead of an unpleasant surprise!"

With the amount of offices around this location it seems to cater to the to-go orders instead of people dining-in. To accommodate the to-go portion they have about 10 parking spaces reserved up front.\n\nThey've got the food preparation and to-go portion managed well, however, because of the limited seating people seem to walk around looking for a place to sit. Not a big deal because of how good the food is but just something to be aware of. During the warmer weather they accommodate for the limited seating with outdoor seating."
