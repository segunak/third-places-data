With that being said the issues I have with this location is for one to park here is extremely difficult. There is never enough parking and most times you have to park in front of a completely different building just to get coffee here.  Then as you walk a distance to get to the front you see that there is consistently someone that thinks they don't have to follow the rules or the law and they park in front of the door in the middle of the roundabout by the front entrance.  And for whatever reason every time I have been to this location the staff here seem disgruntled and very unhappy. Today the barista Diane Cracked a smile or two with the person in front of me but as soon as I get up to her she gives me this look of \"what do you want\".  It was about 11:15 AM and she was the only one working behind the counter, is there a staffing issue?  Also this location never seems to be as clean and tidy as the other locations I frequent. And when I say frequent I go to Starbucks many times twice a day. Whoever manages this location needs to get it together!"

I was told it was, but the barista didn't check nor did she ask any other person to check (which would have taken minimal effort from her). Finally, 22 minutes after my order was submitted, a guy behind the counter calls my name and tells me \"I just found this sitting here. We're out of croissants now. What else can I get you?\". I explain that I ordered it 20some minutes ago and asked for someone to check, and he brushed me off. I was made late for an apt but being a little extra late to write this is worth it, so hopefully other customers are warned and their regional manager can get involved."
