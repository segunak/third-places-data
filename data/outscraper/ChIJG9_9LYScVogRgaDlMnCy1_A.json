Newbies are welcome and they host tournaments for the experienced players. They have drafted beer  too.\n\n* I didn't take pictures of the tables for respect of the pleople playing, but they have many of them.

I think cleanliness could just use a tad bit of adjustment. I noticed a cat roaming around when I went in there once, and the smell was pretty strong. However, I don't want it to seem like I disliked the place. Going in there to grab paints, pick up some cards, or just browse was totally fine :)"

They provide both standing and sitting tables that allow for patrons to coordinate and play tabletop games. They allow food and beverages to be brought in to consume. They also offer a few alcoholic beverages on tap, along with non-alcoholic beverages from a cooler behind the counter.\n\nThe prices are fair and it is a good, local business that you should be proud to supoort. They offer a discord channel to help people connect with other gamers to game with. The staff is always friendly, kind, and willing to share any information they have about any of the games they have or know about. They help you connect with artists in the community or businesses you might be looking for. If you have a specific game purchase request, they will order it for you if they have access to it and they provide updates to you by phone calls to let you know the progress.\n\nMy one truly critical observation is that there is an extremely pungent and sharp odor similar to a men's locker room that is difficult to ignore. The odor hits you immediately upon opening the doors and it is very powerful. If you are sensitive to strong odors, this may be something to consider. This can be controlled by shampooing the carpets regularly or even removing the carpets that trap most of that odor and simply allowing the concrete to be on the floor."

They have snacks and drinks available for when you get hungry during a long session. And there's also a wall of demo games so you can get a feel for the games you're interested in before you buy them.\n\nHighly recommended."
