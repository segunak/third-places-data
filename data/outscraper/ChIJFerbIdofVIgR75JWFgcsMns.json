Since then, I have experience odd and discomforting interactions a specific staff member has with a specific type of person. I am not going to irresponsibly go spewing wild accusations, BUT I left the review solely based on my disappointment in the apparent lack of morality. The coffee is great!

The Smelly Cat exudes character, inviting patrons into a warm, cozy interior adorned with local art and bathed in the aroma of freshly roasted beans. Every day my Smelly Cat experience is truly extraordinary Chilling on the porch during the summer, cooled by gentle fans, or chatting in the shaded seating area surrounded by blooming flowers - the attention to detail in creating a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing environment is evident. And yes, there's even parking, a rarity in this bustling neighborhood.\nNow, let's talk about the in-house baked goods - a symphony of flavors that dances on your palate. Crafted with love and attention, these treats complement the coffee offerings perfectly. The Irish coffee, a signature drink, is an embodiment of indulgence, with crunchy sugar crystals atop cold foam, creating a delightful contrast to the richness of the roasted beans. But what truly elevates Smelly Cat is its family-owned and operated ethos. This isn't just a coffee shop; it's a community hub where you're not a customer but a cherished member of the Smelly Cat family. The staff, with their genuine warmth, welcome you by name, creating an atmosphere that feels like a home away from home. The owner's presence is felt in every corner, ensuring that every order is not just fulfilled but crafted with love and precision.\nThe Smelly Cat Coffeehouse & Roastery isn't just a coffee shop; it's an experience, a celebration of community, culture, and the simple joy found in a cup of expertly crafted coffee. If you're in Charlotte, seeking more than just a caffeine fix, Smelly Cat is the destination where the aroma of authenticity and the spirit of NoDa blend seamlessly."

The name \"Smelly Cat\" itself is a nod to the place's commitment to standing out, inspired by the iconic song from \"Friends.\"\nAs a coffee enthusiast, Smelly Cat is my playground. Since 2012, they've been roasting their specialty coffee, and each sip is a journey through Charlotte's rich coffee culture. From single-origin pour-overs to nitrogen-infused cold brews, the menu is a testament to their dedication to quality.\nThe details at Smelly Cat are what make it extraordinary. Picture yourself on the porch in the summer, cooled by gentle fans, or finding solace in a shaded seating area surrounded by blooming flowers - every nook and cranny is designed for comfort. And, a coffee shop with parking in NoDa? That's a rare gem.\nThe in-house baked goods are a culinary masterpiece, perfectly complementing the coffee offerings. But what truly sets Smelly Cat apart is the family-owned and operated atmosphere. The staff greets you by name, and the owner's presence is felt, creating a warm and inviting space.\nThe Smelly Cat Coffeehouse & Roastery isn't just a coffee shop; it's a celestial experience. If you're in Charlotte and crave more than just a caffeine fix, Smelly Cat is the place to \"Smell the Cat\" - an olfactory journey through the finest coffee in the city.

You need to ask to sit inside, as if it's a speakeasy not a coffee shop\n5. They assign seating for you\n6. It's a rather confusing set up for new customers that makes people uncomfortable and unwanted\n\nOverall the coffee was fine, expensive to say the least but you wouldn't know until you're ready to ring up because there are no prices listed. I'd describe this coffee shop as progressive, pretentious, and unwelcoming."

Even better, I can easily grab my coffee from the walk up window when I'm walking my dog in the neighborhood, since there's no need to go inside. Sometimes, my pup even gets offered a puppacino! Oh, one more thing: a latte at Smelly Cat automatically comes with a double shot. Score!"

I am beyond disappointed and upset. their coffee isn't even that good so i will never waste my time or money here again & neither should you."

Ceiling covered in bags from coffee beans. Design is five star. Customer service and experience is definite 3 star.  They just miss in making you feel welcome. The drinks are odd mixes. The wake up is a weird mix of flavors. Not my thing.

The owner was more than accommodating- she explained the menu and even suggested samples before we ordered to make sure we got coffee that we really enjoyed! She went above and beyond to make sure our experience was excellent. They make all of their syrups and even roast their own coffee! The inside has a few tables and does have AC, she does lock the front door though always so just order at the window first and she will give you a table inside if you'd like, or there are lots of spaces outside to sit too! I had the lavender cold brew and it was delicious. My friend who came with got a decaf latte with spiced brown sugar syrup (which was homemade) & that was fantastic too! They also have some Cuban coffee that I would love to give a try too! We didn't order food, but would've gotten a bagel, frittata (only served on weekends), donut, or sandwich. Highly recommend this cozy, welcoming coffee shop!"

Perfect way to start the morning.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice. When I showed up, a few people had brought their dogs, others were just catching up. It was a nice peaceful spot that felt very local. It was the sort of spot you wished you lived next to so you could walk there for a nice moment with coffee/tea in the sun. There is also a shaded patio in the back where dogs aren't allowed, if that's your thing.\n\nThere is a parking lot and plenty of space when I went. People didn't seem to stay too long but long enough for a cup of coffee. People were a mix of individuals and groups, some working some chatting, some just enjoying the weather"

We went up to a window to ask what we needed to do. That guy told us to go up to the other window, skip the line, and tell them we had a reservation. I did that. The person at that window said we needed to wait in line, order our food, and then we'd be let inside. What was the point of having a reservation if we had to be in the same line as everyone else? When we finally got inside, my friend received her food and coffee, and I didn't receive mine. My friend sat there not eating until an employee walked by and asked why she wasn't enjoying her food. That was the only reason I ever even got my food. The breakfast burrito was tiny, but the coffee was good. We walked down the street and got Reigning Doughnuts immediately afterward because we were still hungry. All in all, it was a disappointing stop.

The parking is non-existent, the setup is inconvenient, which if the coffee was amazing I would completely look over. I drink black coffee and dark roasts are my go to, but I think there was something not right with this coffee. There was something about it that was bitter/almost burnt, that left a bad aftertaste after each sip. The breakfast options are a great idea, I do wish there were options for adding something spicy, different sauces, etc. As far as I could tell there weren't any listed on the board."

After awkward silence, we asked again and were told we'd have to get back in line--which was 16 people long at this point due to the \"iPad issue\"--and order again. No thanks.\n\nTo make sure we hadn't paid for the second drink, I asked for a receipt. He said he could only text or email it, so I gave my phone number. Realizing that he was only pretending to take down the number, probably assuming I'd be walking away, I told him I'd wait at the window until it came through. Then, he got a pen and asked for the number again. What respectable service. \n\nThe one drink was good, so I'll give them a second star for that, but the service is clearly lacking."

(25$ btw) Got the coffees right away and it was BAD.  It was very bitter and we didn't even get half way through before throwing them away. They made us step aside for the food so that they can serve the customers behind us in line.  Well we waited... and waited... and there was no indication our food was done other than the fact that people that stood behind us in line were getting their complete order and no one ever said anything to us.  We went back to barista at the window that had our food sitting behind her the entire time!! Halfway back to the car we realized we were missing half of the order so we had to walk all the way back (parking was full so we were 2 blocks away.) luckily the quiche was actually pretty tasty so they mildly redeemed themselves.  Over all, not a great experience.  This is a place where if you judge it by it's cover it should be good but in reality the looks surpass the quality.  Go to Amelie's instead."

The shop has a great atmosphere both inside and out. Plenty of people hanging out in the patio areas, which were on the front, side and in the back under a big tree. My wife had a chai tea which was ok but didn't have the kick she was expecting for a chai. I had a mocha frappe which was good but the roasted coffee flavor was very strong making it unbalanced. I had hoped they had some sugar free offerings in their syrups, but the only thing they had were some sugar free teas. We also had a piece of zucchini bread which was pretty good. Overall I'd give it a 3.5."

They even asked how our latte was when we went to order seconds. Also if you are visiting with a dog there is a side window to order and plenty of outdoor seating.

Outdoor seating is enough to appease the crowds and the wait time is minimal, not to mention there's free wifi. I recommend looking at their specialty menu, the alcoholic drinks are awesome! Didn't even taste too strong like other drinks I've tried. The parking is usually ok but keep in mind they close kinda early and will close off the parking lot by 5pm. Overall great spot for some affordable tasty coffee."

It was so nice to find out that they kept it open after Richard passed a few years ago. I would suggest anything they have to offer. From pastries to coffee and beer and some wines, you can't beat their price. My over all favorite is their sledgehammer. A shot of their house made espresso with a little chocolate.  It give just the right sweetness but with the true taste of the coffee bean. Not to mention, the smelly cat is names as you've guessed it, from Phoebe from Friends and her song \" smelly cat\" it's definitely an on the list of things to see in NODA."
