Bright and early at 7 AM I went there to get something to eat.  Immediately, it seemed as though young girl with the ponytail this morning, 7 AM, was not very happy that I didn't know exactly what I wanted, immediately. More importantly, when I received my order, which was the blueberry muffin that was warmed.  The same girl young girl with the ponytail, took the item out of the oven, put it in plastic container, walked toward the cashier and....just held her hand out. I repeat, Just held her hand out. My son and I was standing away from the front counter, about 3 meters. She said nothing. My son whom I didn't get to stop in time, walked over to her to get it. Which, of course, she said nothing. Not thank you, not Have a nice day. Nothing.\nMy son took the plastic container from her hand and, picked up the other plastic container on the counter.  Once we were on our way, he realized it was not the right order.  So, sometime this morning Amelie's must have realized a French Toast order was not received. Whose fault is that? The young girl with the ponytail from the 7am shift this morning.\nWe all have days we're tired or such. However, Customer Service  is of most importance. I'm not sure what excuse Ms. Young Lady has, but I do hope I will not experience this anymore. Amelie's has always been a fav of mine."

Wow, we had to try it.\n\nGood stuff:\nAtmosphere was amazing! Had a fun play on French art and history. Really bright and colorful.\nCranberry chicken salad sandwich on a croissant was great!\n\nLess Cool Items:\nRegular croissants are not cooked long enough. They are buttery and big, but lack a golden flaky crust that really defines a croissant. Great for a sandwich but not to eat alone.\nThe quiche was burnt on the bottom and way over salted in the middle. Couldn't eat the crust (pictured)\nThe French toast description looked divine... but the brioche was dry and sliced ultra thin; not what anyone would want in a luscious bite of French toast. Also, the syrup was fridge cold. (Pictured)\nThe pastries were meh, kind of like day old baked goods with lots of sugar.\nWe bought six macaroons to give away to friends back home because they were beautiful. After eating one, they were very chewy and overly sweet. The remaining five stayed in our fridge for a few days before being tossed out untouched.\n\nOverall it was disappointing. I was amazed at the large crowds while simultaneously sad that they haven't experienced a true quaint cafe and bakery found on just about every street corner in Paris. I wish them continued success and hope they work on tweaking their recipe's."

This was a completely different tone from the first 2 times I visited this place. I'm really disappointed and probably won't return. Waiting 30 minutes for the food or more is completely unacceptable.  My friend ended up trying to wave someone over to ask if that was her drink just sitting in the counter for the last 20 minutes and instant of bringing it over to the table the lazy young lady just spoke to us, the consumers, from across the counter that you have to come get it. Are you serious right now? Absurd! We didn't have to do that the last time we were there.  We even ordered at a different  end of the counter on this visit. I was really impressed with this small Cafe the first couple of times I went. This third visit made me hate that I spent my hard earned money on subpar service and food, for people who can't bother to get my order correct or to make sure their patrons are taken care of. That's why it took me so long to do the review because I get so pissed everytime I think about it. Although I've yet to try one of the patries, and i was really looking forward to it, but I seriously doubt I will return."

Like other Amelie's locations, they are mostly well known for their pastries and coffee, but I went with a friend to sample their other menu items.\nI ordered a wrap, and she, the French onion dip(officially, some kind of toasted beef sandwich with melted cheese that you dunk in the bowl of French onion). Both were incredibly hot and fresh. It was delivered to our table in a timely manner, and it tasted pretty consistent with other locations.\nNot too expensive, and the decorations were fun and lighthearted. I attached images about the surrounding visuals just so you can get a better sense of the atmosphere. I give it top marks for a chill afternoon rendezvous.\nWhen we arrived it was already black dark out, but the place was still fairly packed. I figure they must be doing something right. Not exactly my scene, but I completely get it. We were there for about 3 hours talking, and the staff didn't bother us at all.\nI wouldn't recommend it if you're looking to study, or write over your coffee. It was much too loud for that. Many parents brought crying children, and they seemed almost encouraged to let them run around at a breakneck pace. Don't come if you expect relaxation. It's more like a tiki bar, or a mall terminal. Teens and young adults are heavily encouraged to visit.\n4/5 is fair."

This is my second french bakery shop for my breakfast.  I am guessing Charlotte has a lot of French influence?  my requirement is simple, as long as cafe provides specious work/relax environment, variety of the foods, and ok internet connection, they are my go-to cafe, and this Amelie's French bakery & cafe is definitely one of them.  (I did not go to another one, so I can't be sure the others)\n\nFrench bakery shop is known for their sweet tooth bakery, and they offer any possible pastry that you can think of.  on the top, the shop also offer breakfast sandwich, lunch style food offer the  customers from the whole journey from savory to sweet, cold to hot.  I order Monte Cristo with cappuccino and ending with petite pecan tart, they are freshly made and delicious to eat.   this cafe is spacious I estimate can fit around 50 people comfortably, in fact the place is too big the store decoration is a bit eccentric that they put everything French related into the decoration.   I guess it's the French style that everything needs to be add to the flourish \n\nin summary, if you visiting Charlotte town, please be sure to spend around 3 hours to visit Amelie's cafe to enjoy the delicious foods, comfortable seating, and kind staff.\n\nP.S - did I mention their internet Is fast?   \n\nPaul"

The sweet lady with the blue hair was not only so professional but also welcoming. The gentleman with the glasses at the register was beyond kind and seemed to have the attitude of someone who strives to make everyones day better in anyway he can. Even down to the person who brought out my food, so much care was had for me as someone who just simply ordered a sandwich. I can't express the impact this experience had on me. It brought me to tears at my table. You never know what someone is going through and how massive such a simple interaction can mean to them. I would love for everyone who manages or has any higher position with Amelies to know that these three individuals not only changed my day but also left a massive impact on me. Thank you!"

They have one person working the register and one person manning the pastries. During Saturday morning rush!  If you don't have enough people working then start paying more!

Horrible smell of urine in the \"gender neutral\" bathroom, graffiti on the door, no mirror over the sink-I felt like I was in a run down gas station bathroom. Secondly, my chicken salad was so bland and tasteless, and the croissant tasted like it was made last week- it was so dry I could barely swallow! Amelie's used to be a great restaurant in NoDa, before they relocated, but the new NoDa location is an absolute disappointment and a completely overrated establishment. I won't be returning."

And for that person, who's one job appears to be to ring up very simple orders to look perturbed when someone dares interrupt their browsing is annoying to say the least. There needs to be a dedicated coffee line. Food quality is good, but ruined by bad service."

The ordering process is now very much like a McD's or something, definitely not personable in any way. The room didn't have any \"flow\" past the ordering line. The art was cool, but so separated from each other that it felt chintzy/mass-produced instead of unique and local.  I could understand satellite/franchise locations using this model, but it's definitely not a Charlotte attraction any more and we didn't spend any more time there than necessary.\n\nMy pastry was on par with expectations, and I thought the staff was lovely, but not worth the 20 min drive."

The most disappointing thing was the croque monsieur, it tasted horrible, for $10 I expected more, it had a lot of dijon mustard witch hits you as soon as you take a bite, it overpowered the flavor of everything, bechamel was split and overall the whole sandwich was bad, I was not able to finish it.

It should be sweet and a thick consistency. Very disappointing. Secondly, I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which I requested to be toasted as I feel it should be warm. It was served cold. A croissant should be soft and airy and flacky. Not firm, dense, and flavorless. I have been to local bakeries. I'm from the area and have been to so much better quality barkeries with tremendous customer service."

I got the chicken salad on toasted gluten free bread w/ a side of fruit. First, the gentleman cashier could not seem to understand what toasted meant. Then, it took 13 minutes to prepare a likely pre-mixed chicken salad on a toasted bread with a cup of fruit. When it arrived, it was cold. The whole thing. Not just the top. I asked the server for some mayo. He brought me a seasoned mayo to spread on a chicken salad sandwich that has a whole different flavoring that would not go along with what he brought me. So, I began to eat without mayo. I got halfway through my fruit and was welcomed with a small hair firmly attached to the honeydew. This was not a good experience today. Also tell the five people standing around at the registers up front that there are likely jobs that could be done; starting with checking on orders and getting them delivered before they get cold. I'm not completely negative. I did love the chocolate gluten-free tea cake."

After we ordered and sat down someone came from the back saying she was not allowed inside, we asked if there was an outside area he told us they had a patio so we went to the patio and sat down to wait for our order, after having all our food and drinks two people came out saying my dog was not even allowed on the patio, that we could sit at the tables in front of the establishment. Once again we complied but not only the tables were dirty but also no one from the staff even offered to help us bring out all our food.
