I came to this restaurant after searching for \"BEST VEGAN BREAKFAST\" in Charlotte, NC, and when we arrived the cashier said almost everything here can be made vegan. We ordered a \"VEGAN\" MAPLE SAUSAGE EGG AND CHEESE SANDWICH. The cashier brought our food to the table, and we started to eat. A bite or two into the sandwich and we noticed that it tasted and looked JUST LIKE real MEAT. I brought the sandwiches back to the counter, and asked the manager were these VEGAN, because they taste like meat. He said almost verbatim \"WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE VEGAN SAUSAGE, SO WE JUST GAVE IT TO YOU THE REGULAR WAY\". I was applaud, and extremely disappointed they gave us PORK and no one apologized or tried to accommodate for our experience. I tried to stomach it, and continue eating my side of grits, but started throwing up midway. I've been vegan for 15 years, my wife 4 years, and my 8 year old son for his whole life. I must say this is the WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD."

She named everything fried it seems plus all flate breads. You got coffee and a burger to choose from at this point. She wasn't rude per-say but she wasn't plesant either seemed very annoyed to be there. I will give credit to the burger being good and the coffee tasting good.  However, I don't recommend and I'll not be returning either. If I want to pay almost 70$ for that type of service I'll at the least go where I have menu option or better yet a better attitude to make up for having nothing. Attitude means a lot to me bc customer service is rather worth a bad spot over great food and horrible service."

And I paid extra for sausage... no sausage. It's a vegan burrito basically which I didn't order and was charged for the extras. It was missing sauce as well. I'm not sure how you ignore an entire order and make it how you want? I called up there 3 times and of course nobody answered. There's other spots I normally go to but I wanted to try something new.

We're not coffee experts, but he didn't care about that, he helped us without judgement. Ben was just an all around pleasure, we really enjoyed talking with him. We already plan to visit him again tomorrow!\n\nAfter ordering, I enjoyed one of the best latte's ever. I am so glad to see that Queen City Grounds has improved their staff. It is so nice to feel welcome when visiting the neighborhood coffee shop. I'm hoping this could our spot, maybe even our home away from home!\n\nIf you're looking for top notch service and quality coffee, I think this is the place!"

When I saw the number of vegan options on QCG's menu, it seemed too good to be true. I ordered three different breakfast sandwiches so my husband, toddlers, and I could try a variety, and they were all delicious! Better tasting and more unique than any non-vegan breakfast sandwiches I've had.

I was absolutely stunned & felt sick to my stomach because I've been vegetarian for 6 years. When I asked to be compensated, they told me that they'd be right back and I waited an additional 20 minutes to speak with a manager only for no one to show up... this place does NOT care for its customers or their dietary needs!"

The male barista making my drink put the tiniest splash of syrup in the heavy cream to make the cold foam, so it literally taste like nothing. Also the cold foam was over blended into whip cream consistency it's way too thick. All in all I wasted $14 because I threw it out bc the drink tasted like milk and espresso and I ordered a hazelnut latte. Also the guy barista isn't friendly."

The upstairs is quaint, tucked away, and even has a little library nook.\n\nThis is one of the few shops I'm tempted to buy merch from, their logo is of an owl that is artful yet simplistic.\n\nThey are open later in the day, offer a brunch menu in the morning, a later in the day menu after 3 PM, and alcohol- I assume later in the day, there is a bar with beer taps and a beer fridge.\n\nThey offer events several nights of the week.\n\nWi-Fi password is \"staygrounded\".\n\nThey will validate parking in the Skyhouse garage for 1.5 hrs if you ask. They will hand you a receipt to have scanned upon exiting the garage."

My husband has social anxiety so when he orders he might ask a few extra questions and stumble on his words. You're working with the public learn how to be kind.

Good central spot with easy street parking around, nice huge space with lots of seating, big windows, and table lamps. Quick service and good drinks - the vanilla latte was great. They have The Landing upstairs which I assume hosts some events, because they had a comedy show going on while I was there. Overall, good not-too-unique coffee shop with what you need - seating, lighting, and a comfortable atmosphere. Probably going to be a go To when I'm uptown."

I've recently gotten the Impossible burger and the chicken sand-which and both are amazing. I recommend the ranch on both. The service has been much better and the food comes out in a timely manner. The staff is very friendly. Definitely give this place a try!\n\nMy experiences have been really bad. The first time I ordered a breakfast burrito, it took 45 minutes. They had given food to everyone else that ordered after me. I asked for a status update. Instead of telling me they lost my order or forgot, they just said they were still working on it. How? The second time I went, I ordered online, because I had a little puppy with me. I was working outside, since they had signs on their window saying they can't allow dogs inside. When I ordered online I asked in the comments for them to bring it outside since I can't come in. I waited 30 minutes, before realizing that they must not be bringing it outside. When I went in my order was sitting at the pick up window and they just ignored the note I wrote even though it was printed on the receipt. The sandwich was cold and soggy by the time I got it. Customer service is not their forte. I wanted to support their partnership with Summit Seltzer and new opening at night hours, but they need to work on customer service."

So I got the BLT but couldn't find any bacon on my first half of the sandwich but then I took it apart for the staff to show them I couldn't find Bacon. They showed me a tiny piece on the other half only and didn't seem to want to make another. If you're working on a menu and the first ingredient is bacon, you might expect to have a visible portion on the sandwich. Side note the online menu said on toast but the menu here was on a veggie wrap. Last part of my rant the item said thick cut bacon, the piece we found on one half was the same you see at Subway that's thin and small. I'll try again some other time, the menu looks great and has a lot of appealing options.\nThe building is beautiful and they have a great decor. Thanks for the coffee y'all it was wonderful."

The guy (who I thought was maybe a female...no name tag) at the register stood there pushing buttons on the register when I arrived appearing to be very busy despite the fact I was the only customer in line or waiting.  He didn't say \"one moment\" \"I will be right with you\" or \"can I help you\".  I am a nice guy, so I did not interrupt.  I stood there waiting for him to finish and after about 5 minutes, I assumed the machine was broke.  So, I spoke up and politely asked, \"can I place the order and pay in cash (no change needed).  He then looked up and very smugly said, \"I'm waiting on you to order, what do you want\".  I was instantly annoyed but, like I said, I'm a nice guy and let it go.  I politely apologized for the confusion and ordered my drink.  He was very rude.  Didn't tell me a total, flipped the screen around and walked away.  He whispered several times to the female making the drinks and they just kept looking at me laughing.  When it was done, he grabbed the drink and sat it on the pick up counter and walked away without saying anything.  The drink was horrible having purposely been sabotaged by the female under the man's instruction.  It wasn't an innocent mistake where it was not hot enough or too sweet.  It was not drinkable AT ALL.  I threw the drink away, looked at both of them, and walked out.  I sent two white coworkers there immediately after I left and they did not have the same experience and much better cups of coffee.  In that regard, clearly an isolated incident of racism.  Just a heads up to Management who may or may not be condoning this despicable behavior....this does not stop at my review.  I will be reporting this establishment and incident to the BBB, Chamber, CA, and any other platform to ensure everyone knows what to expect when visiting Queen City Grounds."

The guy taking my order today seemed like he didnt want to be there, he was asking people if they wanted cream or sugar and then after someone replied cream please, he told them to go get it themselves at the self serve bar. Whats the point? Customer service alone is a 1 or 2 out of 5. Lets see how the coffee is.\n\nGot the coffee. One was 4 shots, iced whole milk. The other 3 shots, iced, oat milk. I asked the dark curly haired barista if the milks were correct in the drinks (dairy intolerance) and she literally said, \"I forget at this point\". Not coming back, maybe find better baristas who care about the craft. I paid around $13 and a $2 tip."
