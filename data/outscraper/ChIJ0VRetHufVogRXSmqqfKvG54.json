Low quiet music. Lots of options for coffee, cold brew, baked goods, sandwiches and such.\n\nIt was a little loud when we arrived but the party of mommies with their toddlers moved on after a few minutes.\n\nMy cortado was perfect except for the paper cup. Clearly, Peter's taught them how to do it. Two shots of espresso and an equal amount of steamed (not foamed) milk. Usually served in a short glass but not many places have them so it's a short cup. It was delicious and within 20 minutes, I could feel the caffeine hit me. I'm ready for the day, now!\n\nThis is a busy shopping center and a few cars zipped past the coffee shop. Keep an eye out for that traffic as you back out of your parking space!"

If Madison Perk Coffee Bar were to be built in the metaverse...the digital domain design tab it would live under would be \"Modern Style Cafe\". Click Drag, Drop and Twirl to make it fit into your virtual world.\n\nThe ceilings were high and industrial but painted black so it had a disappearing effect. The floor was vast and of the shined epoxy concrete family line. The blend of wood and earth toned accoutrements were accented by poppin patterned furniture. Fridges hummed noticeably in the distance and contained those little add-on products that your mouth wants but your pockets don't always need. Oh so tempting. The menu was clear and in perfect view above your brain for making a masterful selection from lattes, drips and eats. It was clear....The handbook on how to create a \"Cool Cafe\" had been read.\n\nI settled on a drip coffee and before I could say \"I drink it strong\" I realized this this was their motto posted around the shop. #drinkitstrong . I added the peanut butter banana wrap thingy and sat to sip my Joe while I waited for the food to materialize. The coffee was really mouth friendly and strong but not overly so with a smooth calm finish..like my lady. The wrap arrived hot off the TurboChef and it didn't look like much but tasted pretty good overall. I would've loved the incorporation of some sort of berry or jam dip and perhaps a slightly salted butter glaze on the exterior for that extra pelvic thrust.\n\nBefore I could exit I noticed the stage off in the corner indicating that this place gets active sometimes...and Daddy likes dat. Actually I wanted more of that. I wanted to know who the owner was and what they were into but expressed through more design cues around the shop. Things were very neutral. Anywhooos...I resisted the desire to hit the stage with my Persian Four Fingered Flute and made my exit. When in #Charlotte I'll be back to try more of Madison's Perk...perhaps with a soundtrack. Thanks for reading and I hope this review helps someone make the right cafe decision. Follow along on my journey across everywhere to review absolutely everything! There no review like a ReaL Review.\n\n-ReaL\n\n#cafe #coffee #music #foodie #breakfast #lattes"
