Employers in the drive thru order place are bad, they do not care about the customer and give less than a droplet of attention, thus not hearing the customer's orders. The food is usually good in starbucks, but on this Starbucks it was bad. Not only did they messed up the food, but they hurried with our food as if it was an unimportant task and therefore making the most horrible Starbucks I've ever have gotten the hold of. This Starbucks tasted like nothing, the chocolate was a whole separate thing and the creame was tasteless, not mixed with anything but the very void, the ice was just small ice cubes for the only purpose of making it feel cold at the hold of it. And at last, the employe was not only rude, but made very traumatic and disturbing faces at us and as well with annoyed sounds."

Jordyn didn't even apologize for my experience! As a manager, she handled the situation very horribly especially because she knows I am always in here!
