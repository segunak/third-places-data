SUPER slow no matter what day or time of day, and they never call out orders (by name, what they are, or even just common sense by who is sitting around waiting) and just silently and stealthy place them on the \"to go\" shelf, which is SUPER annoying as you never know when your drink is ready, and even more annoying when you have cold foam and it starts to melt because the employees can't be bothered to do something so simple as just calling out a name. I've never known of any other coffee shop to operate this way."
