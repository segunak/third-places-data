I avoid her at all cost. If she's the only one there, I just don't ask any questions.\nThe staff is always so noisy and I'm unsure if they have a private room for studying or not but since we don't have internet at home, I'm trying to tutor my kids and do my homework when I can.\nDoors should be built on both of the separate children's room spaces. The fullness of the place kinda makes me depressed now walking in.\n\nThe nice nerdy guy with the glasses and orange hair is ALWAYS so helpful and polite. Love asking him for help when we need clarity."
