The madeleine cookies are not overly sweet but are in fact curated in a way that truly highlights the flavor notes making the cookie an experience versus just a sugary treat. Out of the environment and food/drinks, what stands out even more is the absolute warm, inviting and generous customer service. I had accidentally left a to-go order after visiting with my friend and they were incredibly understanding and gave me the opportunity to either get a refund or come pick up a new cheesecake at my convenience. Management is outstanding and they made this process incredibly easy for me. As a customer I was treated with value and felt cared for. They go above and beyond to ensure the customer's experience is one that will have them return again and I absolutely will!"

Also, I loved the fact that the treats were individually wrapped and I could see the owner herself and the employees very regularly wiping tabletops down. Cleanliness is so important to me and this place 100% has it. Speaking of tables, there was plenty of space to sit and enjoy your drinks and treats. Will definitely be going back here! "

There were about three customers sitting in the establishment on laptops. The place was not busy. So, I kind of just wandered around looking at the desserts behind the glass, hoping that someone would say hello or help me or anything. I just walked out and left. I went to Kozi next door and grabbed some Italian street food and picked up a few dessert items there. I won't be back. There are other spots in Charlotte with scones that didn't look dried out."

I expected to pay $8 for a coffee, as is the norm these days, but $12 for a small sandwich is robbery. The dalgona was underwhelming and tasted exactly like the instant coffee we were all making during the pandemic. The egg sandwich had a terrible filling to bread ratio and most of my bites were just the egg mixture. I also noticed on the receipt that was emailed that the ingredients were listed and the sandwich included cheese. Due to health reasons, I consume as little dairy as possible. Who the hell puts cheese in an egg sandwich? I've been spending the last few hours feeling nauseous and trying not to get sick. I highly recommend that anyone with dietary restrictions not make assumptions like I did and thoroughly read the ingredient list for what you're ordering."

I'm fairly certain we discovered them on their soft opening day, when I wanted a late night treat, and as soon as they opened fully...well, we have been every weekend since.\n\nI don't love sweets, but the madeleines are so perfectly made -- a treat without being sickly sweet! The double matcha is the best, but when their weekly rotating flavors includes earl grey or almond, we grab some of those. For us, we buy a stash and they last us as dessert for 3-4 days with NO issue!\n\nWe also love the specialty drinks: a cloud matcha or dalgona latte will always be silky smooth and refreshing...but there's not a beverage we haven't loved."

She gave me a suggestion for a coffee that I had never tried before. I wish that I remembered the name to suggest it to you to order, but it was so delicious! She told me that they make their own coffee foam and also the cookies that they crumble on top. Yum! Not too sweet. Just perfect. I also purchased madeleines and a cookie. I had the citrus madeleine. It was so good! Great texture and moisture content. When I returned home, my daughter tried the churro madeleine. She is already requesting more as she loved it as well. I will definitely return when in the area again."

            "review_text": "Highly disappointing! I had seen so many good reviews and advertising for the Littl Madeleine bakery. I myself am a fan of the classic madeleine cookies and decided to visit the bakery this past Saturday. The store was clean and not too crowded for the weekend. I got a variety of different madeleines to try and a coffee to dine in. The customers in front of me were filming something for content, as what was told to me by the individual who was holding the camera. This filming included having their madeleine cookies neatly packed in a box and wrapped in a bow of the customer's choosing. When I proceeded to checkout afterward, I did not receive anywhere close to this type of treatment, instead, I got a simple flip of the card reader asking for a tip and no help in getting all my merchandise off the table. I had to physically reach across the counter, which left a cold interaction with the cashier. Finding a table was not an issue, but upon sitting down and trying the cookies, I found all of the madeleine cookies to be dry and lacking flavor. All the cookies were extremely dense and lacked the crisp exterior and moist interior that madeleine cookies are known for. If I had to rank them in the order of decent to worst it would be: the chocolate-covered one, the lemon, mocha, and dead last, the vanilla. The vanilla madeleines compared to the taste of dry cornbread. My friend also tried a peanut butter cookie and a chocolate chip cookie as well, which disappointed both of us. The chocolate chip cookie can only be described as the texture of sand in one's mouth, and the peanut butter cookie lacked flavor. The coffee was not bad, but as a bakery that names itself after this iconic cookie, I find it difficult to support them if they can't even get that correct."

After ordering, I immediately noticed all of the processed and unnatural flavored syrups for the drinks. I was so shocked that this business advertises high quality ingredients and what I got was half quality but for a premium price.\n\nHere is a copy and paste from their website:\n\n\"Our commitment to environmental kindness, farmer welfare, and the consumption of pure, unprocessed foods is deeply ingrained in our business ethos. Every decision we make reflects this philosophy. For us, sustainability is not a marketing strategy; it's a daily, deliberate choice that guides our operations.\"\n\nI would highly recommend this business to either:\n\n1.) Stop advertising their use of high quality ingredients if they are going to continue to mix high quality with subpar ingredients and still charge a premium price (greenwashing).\n\n2.) Commit entirely to using high quality ingredients and remove any artificial ingredients, so you can honestly provide a high quality service at a premium price.\n\nI really don't like leaving these kind of reviews but I feel it is necessary to let other health conscious customers be made aware before they try this cafe. I feel it is greenwashed and falsely advertised and worst of all, you're being charged a premium for ingredients that are mixed with artificial ingredients."

The coffee was good, but honestly not amazing. Maybe also because when I got it, it was slightly warm. Had to drive home and rewarm it back up, which was unfortunate. First time having basque cheesecake so I don't have anything to compare to, but it was creamy and delicious. I visited on a weekday and they didn't have much in the window available. Not sure if they only have roll cakes available on the weekend, I was looking forward to getting one. Bummer since I live 30 mins away so I can't swing by as often as I would like to.\n\nI found myself having some questions after leaving and it is impossible to get a hold of anyone. No phone numbers available and no responses on their social medias. :("

The madeleines and scones were not only delicious but also reflected the use of high-quality ingredients across their offerings. The organic coffee and tea added another layer of excellence to the experience. I'm looking forward to revisiting this delightful spot in the future."
