My cousin and I went up to the register, and we were trying to be cordial but she barely said a word to us and gave us long, dirty stares the whole time. After I paid, she gave me the receipt, but then she crumpled up the cafe coupon right in front of me and just stood there waiting for us to leave. Like what the heck??? I don't know what the problem was, but it made me feel really judged and uncomfortable. I don't usually leave negative reviews, but I'm sure I would have gotten fired at my previous job for treating a shopper like that."

We got a little lost looking for it, and of course in true book shopping fashion, ended up filling our arms with more find than we were aiming for. We even found ATEEZ' most recent EP (ATEEZ THE WORLD EP.1 :MOVEMENT)! I was pretty excited, after purchasing all our finds; we spent the afternoon unboxing our albums and reading though a few books; before checking out their vinyl collection then heading out. It was a great trip to the boom store, the are is lovely and honestly, I couldn't imagine a better time!"

Excellent selection of books from all genres. Decent selection of board games too. The only part of the store that felt a teensy bit like it didn't fit was the large movie area. It just felt like a huge space that was not very full. The cashier was super friendly and kind. All in all, great experience. Oh and parking was easy!"

A lady by the name of Cynthia was assisting me and was very sweet and helpful. She apparently needed some assistance and called for help and at that point an associate showed up told her to cancel out of her screen and through the book at me and said here you can go now! Her attitude belonged at a fast food restaurant where that kind of service is expected! My entire interaction with this associate was beyond horrible and I expect in today's time you need to be able to keep your customers! With the way I was treated by this associate I will not return to that store! The store manager Michael attempted to handle the situation and provided me with your district manager contact info. I highly suggest putting your employee through a customer service class so she learns how to interact in a civilized manner!!"
