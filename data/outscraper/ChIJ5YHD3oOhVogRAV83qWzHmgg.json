Him knowing how much I love local coffee shops and supporting small businesses, he took me to The Daily Ritual. Right off the bat when you walk into this \"feel-good,\" shop we were greeted by the owner with a warm welcome! He was very nice and easy to talk too, in a sense it made you feel like a regular even if it was your first time there. He recommended two coffees, The Ritual and the Vanilla Bean Lattes. I, being a cinnamon lover, got the Cinnabon Latte with no moo milk (had almond milk!) and my husband got The Ritual. I would have never thought to put cardamon in coffee until trying The Ritual and I will definitely have to say, you have to give this coffee a try! Both coffees were delicious and warmed us up both perfectly on this cold day. We also ended up having the Croissant Caprese which tasted just like you were eating a Caprese but with bread!\n\nHighly recommend stopping by this cozy shop. Coffee was great, food was great, atmosphere inviting but most of all the owner was so welcoming and personable!"

Best of luck and many blessings to your new shop Hassn. Until next time.\n\nMs. CANDICE WATKINS"

I ordered a espresso shot \"for here\" and it was given to me in a cool/decorative mug (it stuck with the vibes and branding). I had asked for a sidecar as well (soda water), and he managed to grab one for me too. He was very open to hearing suggestions and thoughts on his coffee as I had explained that I do espresso reviews for myself often. The espresso was pretty solid, very smooth, not as strong/oily thick compared to other espressos here in Charlotte (which is what prefer), but if you were looking for some smooth coffee drinks, this is the place! They're merging with Sip City (beer/wine shop), and their space is comfortable and chill. Good place to hangout with friends and hold conversations!"

Despite ongoing construction out front, the inside of the shop was peaceful, with very little noise if any filtering in.\n\nThe proprietor of the coffee shop recommended \"the Ritual,\" a latte flavored with a bit of cardamom. Cardamom is a love it or hate it kind of spice, but I happen to enjoy it so I took him up on his recommendation and I am happy that I did.\n\nThe spice was balanced expertly by the dairy, so much so that it could be worth a shot for those who are on the fence about cardamom.\n\nWill be back soon."
