Only downside is the space is a little small - thankfully, I was solo that day but I'd say all in all the shop only has 8 seats so just be aware of that if it gets busy. Since it's in the Alley though, you could find seating outside or at the park across the street. Also, street parking is really rare so you may have to circle the area a bit to find a place to park if you don't want to pay for a garage. All in all, the shop is so cute and has some nice vibes and treats!"

Personally, I'm a huge fan of the french toast latte or any of the fruit smoothies with popping boba. I've always felt that the price is fair, the drinks are delicious and packed with flavor (and plenty of boba), and the desserts are always moist and fresh!!!! A million times over, thank you thank you thank you! My favorite independent cafe in all of charlotte, located in the heart of Uptown! The owner is extremely kind hearted, and will always ensure your experience at her establishment is a great one. Can't reccomend this place enough :-)"

It was the Pina Colada (no alcohol) with added Boba that had her so excited, she began to jump in place (lol). She described her drink as \"The best Boba I've tried! And, it has pineapple pieces, too!\" It was a joy for me to watch; especially since she hadn't lit up like that in a while.\n\nWe discovered this new gem from a media outlet online. After reading it- I used it as a homeschooling lesson for my daughter to learn about another entrepreneur's business that operates in excellence, and is black woman owned! This opportunity was sweetened by today's in-person visit. The Owner was warm, welcoming, and created a personal experience for us to shop with & be served by the CEO! I could tell she appreciated us. My daughter already has plans to go back with her siblings! And, I'll happily return to treat myself."
