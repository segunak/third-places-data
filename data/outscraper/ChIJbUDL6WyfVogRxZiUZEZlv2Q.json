Suffolk Punch isn't at all hard to find, right off South Tryon and they have a dedicated parking lot. So that's just awesome.\n\nWe seated ourselves at the table and Erin came by to take our drink order. A mocktail for Mrs. K. and a pilsner for me and when she returned with the drinks, we ordered a \"flatbread\" that really is a pizza.\n\nIt did take a bit considering the restaurant was almost empty but it was worth it. Burrata and cherry tomatoes and a balsamic drizzle. Absolutely delicious and reasonably priced.\n\nWe were here for at least an hour and I feel a whole bunch of destressed. Will need to return as their Monday night special is half off on burgers!"

I think if I really had to nit pick I would have wanted it to be more warmed up/ hot and then I think it would have made it taste even better. It was just barely warm/ at room temperature, but still tasted good nonetheless.\n\nWe also got their seasonal Cinnamon Toast Crunch cappuccino and their classic chicken biscuits. The chicken was season very well and the gravy was really tasty. The biscuit itself is different so I can see some people either not liking it as much or really love it.\n\nOverall, everything tasted good and the waiters and staff were really nice and the overall restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Their parking lot is really small btw so you will need to plan maybe ahead to find some parking near by. I'd come back here again a solid 7.5/10. "

It's conveniently located near our home and directly on the light rail, making it easy for anyone exploring Charlotte. They offer great upscale bar bites, weekly specials (like half-priced salads on Wednesdays), breakfast, a coffee bar, and in-house brewery options. The ambiance is consistently good and changes throughout the day, making it a perfect spot for remote work in the morning and a post-work drink in the evening.\n\nSuffolk offers a refreshing atmosphere with a diverse crowd and a consistent, friendly staff who know us well. It's within walking or a quick driving distance of several other breweries, ideal for a brewery crawl, and has direct light rail access from the outdoor space. We visit with or without our kids for casual hangs and have had many business lunches here (and no, it doesn't feel like a playground like some breweries in CLT do). The back patio is very dog-friendly, great for people-watching, and the industrial warehouse space is beautifully decorated with hanging plants and a moody interior."

We sat on the patio, which was the perfect spot to enjoy a sunny Sunday afternoon.\n\n*UPDATE* Visited for brunch for the first time and was once again impressed! The chicken biscuit was amazing. I got it with a side salad, which was the perfect balance.\n\nI'm a fan for life!"

The Suffolk Punch Brewing South Park burger was a flavor explosion - the Irish Oaks Grass Fed Beef paired perfectly with the fresh Bibb Lettuce, Tomato, Shaved Onion, and those unforgettable Drunken Pickles. And let's not forget about the ooey-gooey goodness of the cheddar cheese and SPG sauce, all nestled in a delightful local bun from QCP Co. Perfection on a plate!And as for their brews, the Work Horse pale ale citra was a revelation. It was hoppy, crisp, and refreshing - the ideal companion for a Thursday evening. And speaking of Thursdays, their $3 Thursday deal is an absolute steal!From the moment you step through the doors, you're greeted with warmth and hospitality. Suffolk Punch Brewery has definitely earned a permanent spot on my list of favorite spots in town. Can't wait for my next visit!\""

The fish was cooked perfectly, the batter for the fish was seasoned perfectly,  fries on point, and the slaw had jalapenos in it which was a nice twist.  They have a huge outdoor area so I can see this place getting packed on warm nights.  If you drive there I can see parking being an issue if it's going to be busy, but we were visiting - I'm sure the locals know the parking secrets.  Next time we're in CLT this will definitely be a destination!"

And both Eryn and Nick gave me a few samples of beer til I found the one I liked!\n\nOn that note...the beer was fantastic. Every single one. And the food was unreal.

Today Tuesday (four days later) it just posted to my account and I was charged $8.58 for my first beer and $9.10 for my second beer. I have all the receipts to prove. Unfortunately I can not get anyone on the phone to resolve this issue. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL BE SCAMMED! If you do choose to come, always ask for a receipt and check your bank statements. This is disgusting to think they would do this and how many people they do it to and get away with it!"

We were seated promptly, but our waitress seemed to not be able to look at us, AT ALL!! Now I thought she might have just been a little bit off that day... but we watched how she interacted with every other table she had, and it was a completely noticeable difference. The only difference was we were the only black people seated at that time. It was obvious to my whole group. It was very awkward and made us very uncomfortable.  We ended up ordering mimosas and leaving shortly after.  Needless to say, we will not be making another trip there. Hopefully, this was just that individual, and i hope anyone else that looks like me will not have to encounter this waitress."

They also get really busy on the weekends and I believe they host live music in the venue/stage next to the main building. They're literally right at the New Bern light rail stop so theres no issue with parking!"

Of course we ordered the Chicken Biscuit and also got a side of the cheesy grits which were PHENOMENAL. Coffees were also great during the cold rainy day we were having. Also got some little treats that were displayed at the front register area. What I wasn't a fan of was the service. No one greeted us when we walked in (except the fellas in the back by the beer) and upon reviewing the menu, my partner and I felt rushed and as if we were an inconvenience.  No one came to see if we needed anything our entire meal and no one attempted to tell us to have at the least a \"day\" when we left. Overall....would I visit again? For the food - Yes!! but if I have the same rude vibes, it will more than likely be the last time."

Service was so quick!!\n\nHere's what I tried:\n- Grains and Things ($16): Large portion. Loved the ingredients. But the chicken was a little difficult to cut and there was too much goat cheese for my taste. Still good though!\n- Fungus Among Us ($16): OMG. So much flavor. So delicious.\n- Crispy Brussels ($6): Good!\n- Mac-N-Cheese ($6): Yummmm, currently craving this.\n\nSuffolk Punch was awesome! Good for groups, date night, anything! Highly recommend!"

We had the spinach artichoke dip which I really recommend, the thai chili flat bread, and the burger. Pay attention to the menu because the carmalized onion jam has strawberries. I also super appreciate the compostable cutlery. The beer was really good as well. The IPAs as well as the seltzers and the frozen slushie drinks. Not really a bad thing to say!"

Some lacked a welcoming personality. Trevor was the bright spot of the bunch. When weather permits, the outside patio with dedicated bar works great. Very nice coffee bar is a plus.

The environment of the back patio reminded me of a busy cafeteria- loud, hot mayhem. Service was not particularly memorable as you had to scan a QR code and order from your phone- someone would later drop off your order with minimal acknowledgement. I mention this because the brunch wasn't cheap and patrons are often times going to restaurants such as these in part for the experience. The food itself was decent, but nothing I'd return for. The drinks looked like something you might order at a beach bar- no care really taken in making them. Sadly, I don't know that'd return. At least not on a Sunday afternoon."

We all shared the French toast that were muffin tops, chicken biscuit sandwich that is extremely HUGE and the devil eggs! Cocktails were amazing. We definitely will be back to grab some dinner and lunch soon!"

We then went to get our drinks, and the bartenders ignored us immediately then got an attitude because we didn't hear them calling our name but again weren't told how it works at this restaurant. We went to pay and were ignored again but then asked how can I help you with a horrible tone of voice and tossed the receipt. I will never come here or recommend this place to anyone."

I was seated near the kitchen and had a perfect view of the area food is picked up from and delivered to tables. I observed a few of the women playing with/adjusting their hair and then grabbing plates to deliver it to tables. I observed one man that took his hat off adjusted it and put it back on right over the food holding area. These individuals did not wash or sanitize at all. The servers are responsible for adding fries that are held in a bowl to the plates. Because of their lack of cleanliness this was not well received. My food was just ok. My fries were overcooked and just warm. My burger appeared to have unknown particles, thinner than hair so I don't think that's what is was. My friend described her French toast muffin as very bad and something they should rework. It completely fell apart and was very soggy. Our server was nice but the hostess instructed us to wait at the to go ordering area. When someone came he told us to go to the hostess stand. She then said she thought we were ordering to go, not sure why she assumed that or at the least just asked. The best part was the cold brew cocktails, they were very good but would not make me return. Glad I went, now I know."
