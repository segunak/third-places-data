It's conveniently located near our home and directly on the light rail, making it easy for anyone exploring Charlotte. They offer great upscale bar bites, weekly specials (like half-priced salads on Wednesdays), breakfast, a coffee bar, and in-house brewery options. The ambiance is consistently good and changes throughout the day, making it a perfect spot for remote work in the morning and a post-work drink in the evening.\n\nSuffolk offers a refreshing atmosphere with a diverse crowd and a consistent, friendly staff who know us well. It's within walking or a quick driving distance of several other breweries, ideal for a brewery crawl, and has direct light rail access from the outdoor space. We visit with or without our kids for casual hangs and have had many business lunches here (and no, it doesn't feel like a playground like some breweries in CLT do). The back patio is very dog-friendly, great for people-watching, and the industrial warehouse space is beautifully decorated with hanging plants and a moody interior."

We sat on the patio, which was the perfect spot to enjoy a sunny Sunday afternoon.\n\n*UPDATE* Visited for brunch for the first time and was once again impressed! The chicken biscuit was amazing. I got it with a side salad, which was the perfect balance.\n\nI'm a fan for life!"

And let's not forget about the ooey-gooey goodness of the cheddar cheese and SPG sauce, all nestled in a delightful local bun from QCP Co. Perfection on a plate!And as for their brews, the Work Horse pale ale citra was a revelation. It was hoppy, crisp, and refreshing - the ideal companion for a Thursday evening. And speaking of Thursdays, their $3 Thursday deal is an absolute steal!From the moment you step through the doors, you're greeted with warmth and hospitality. Suffolk Punch Brewery has definitely earned a permanent spot on my list of favorite spots in town. Can't wait for my next visit!\""

They have a huge outdoor area so I can see this place getting packed on warm nights.

And both Eryn and Nick gave me a few samples of beer til I found the one I liked!\n\nOn that note...the beer was fantastic. Every single one. And the food was unreal.

I immediately closed the tab for that one beer, leaving a $0 tip bc there's no server. I ordered a second beer, same beer ($7.58) and same process. Ordering from my phone and closing out immediately. Today Tuesday (four days later) it just posted to my account and I was charged $8.58 for my first beer and $9.10 for my second beer. I have all the receipts to prove. Unfortunately I can not get anyone on the phone to resolve this issue. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL BE SCAMMED! If you do choose to come, always ask for a receipt and check your bank statements. This is disgusting to think they would do this and how many people they do it to and get away with it!"

Now I thought she might have just been a little bit off that day... but we watched how she interacted with every other table she had, and it was a completely noticeable difference. The only difference was we were the only black people seated at that time. It was obvious to my whole group. It was very awkward and made us very uncomfortable.  We ended up ordering mimosas and leaving shortly after.  Needless to say, we will not be making another trip there. Hopefully, this was just that individual, and i hope anyone else that looks like me will not have to encounter this waitress."

Overall, great vibe and a great place to grab a beer or watch a game with friends. They also get really busy on the weekends and I believe they host live music in the venue/stage next to the main building. They're literally right at the New Bern light rail stop so theres no issue with parking!"

Of course we ordered the Chicken Biscuit and also got a side of the cheesy grits which were PHENOMENAL. Coffees were also great during the cold rainy day we were having. Also got some little treats that were displayed at the front register area. What I wasn't a fan of was the service. No one greeted us when we walked in (except the fellas in the back by the beer) and upon reviewing the menu, my partner and I felt rushed and as if we were an inconvenience.  No one came to see if we needed anything our entire meal and no one attempted to tell us to have at the least a \"day\" when we left. Overall....would I visit again? For the food - Yes!! but if I have the same rude vibes, it will more than likely be the last time."

Service was so quick!!\n\nHere's what I tried:\n- Grains and Things ($16): Large portion. Loved the ingredients. But the chicken was a little difficult to cut and there was too much goat cheese for my taste. Still good though!\n- Fungus Among Us ($16): OMG. So much flavor.

We had the spinach artichoke dip which I really recommend, the thai chili flat bread, and the burger. Pay attention to the menu because the carmalized onion jam has strawberries. I also super appreciate the compostable cutlery. The beer was really good as well. The IPAs as well as the seltzers and the frozen slushie drinks. Not really a bad thing to say!"

Some lacked a welcoming personality. Trevor was the bright spot of the bunch. When weather permits, the outside patio with dedicated bar works great. Very nice coffee bar is a plus.

The environment of the back patio reminded me of a busy cafeteria- loud, hot mayhem. Service was not particularly memorable as you had to scan a QR code and order from your phone- someone would later drop off your order with minimal acknowledgement. I mention this because the brunch wasn't cheap and patrons are often times going to restaurants such as these in part for the experience. The food itself was decent, but nothing I'd return for. The drinks looked like something you might order at a beach bar- no care really taken in making them. Sadly, I don't know that'd return. At least not on a Sunday afternoon."

I observed one man that took his hat off adjusted it and put it back on right over the food holding area. These individuals did not wash or sanitize at all. The servers are responsible for adding fries that are held in a bowl to the plates. Because of their lack of cleanliness this was not well received. My food was just ok. My fries were overcooked and just warm. My burger appeared to have unknown particles, thinner than hair so I don't think that's what is was. My friend described her French toast muffin as very bad and something they should rework. It completely fell apart and was very soggy. Our server was nice but the hostess instructed us to wait at the to go ordering area. When someone came he told us to go to the hostess stand. She then said she thought we were ordering to go, not sure why she assumed that or at the least just asked. The best part was the cold brew cocktails, they were very good but would not make me return. Glad I went, now I know."

I chose hand cut fries to accompany my tasty sandwich. I also paired that with a margarita from their cocktail menu. I wish I could remember the name of it but it was delicious! Very pleased to have had a great experience the second time around and I look forward to trying them out again soon!"

The food is good and the queso served with blue chips has their own pineapple salsa on top that is very good. Definitely one place to visit again, but next time, take the Light Rail. Great outdoor seating area, too."

Parking is craaazy, arrive at 10am if you can.\nThe venue is beautiful on the inside, and it smells amazing. We didn't wait long, 20 minutes. Our table was dirty when they sat us down , which is a bummer for me because I'm big on cleaning. The man was kind about it and quickly wiped it down ( with a dingy wash rag looking thing ). Our waitress was very short with us, un-atentive and seemed bothered by something. We had to ask several times for basic things such as napkins and forks , extra plates.\n\nChicken buiscut was dry,  the buiscut itself was delicious,  the gravy was delicious but the chicken was so dry. The potatoes were seasoned well, nice crisp .  The French toast was soooo good  !!!! The mimosa was very much just orange juice   . Menu was veeeeery limited for they were shortstaffed in the kitchen. As was explained to us.\n\nI'll return in a few weeks give them another try,  as long as I font get that waitress"

It was buzzing with energy and a lot of noise (if you don't want to be in a noisy, busy restaurant, then I would pick a different one depending on the occasion). Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.\nWe enjoyed a number of drinks and they were all delicious. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. Each portion is a LOT so be aware of that when ordering for the table. I ate so many apps that I could barely eat my pizza. The chicken wings were fried perfectly and seasoned/sauced just right. You couldn't eat them without making a mess and we were completely fine making that mess. The cauliflower app was also very tasty.\nMy pizza was topped with too many things so the middle was soggy and liquid-y. That would have been the only feedback from our evening there. We would definitely go back to eat and try other cocktails."

Get here early, they fill up quick!\n\nPrevious: Food quality, 5 stars. Ambiance, 5 stars. Brunch portions, 5 stars. Service gets 3 for now. It took almost 20 min just to get an acknowledgement from our server. The hostess came over and helped us flag down our server and gave us some water while we waited. From then on, it was great, food came out lightning fast and piping hot once we got our order in.\n\nDefinitely going back, but hopeful for a little better service next time around."
