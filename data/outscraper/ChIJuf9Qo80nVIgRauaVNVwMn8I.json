If you ask any employee something, they don't know.  Then the vibrator never vibrated.  My name never appeared on the screen and the food had been on the counter for about 5 minutes until I was to  look and it was mine.  They forgot the chips and the room was disgusting.

When I finally got to the register, I asked him how long it would take to get me the food and the guy said that it shouldn't take that long, only about 10 minutes. 10 minutes???!!! That's a lot!!! He then asked me to my pull over to the parking lot so that I can receive my food there. You know what that means, waiting another 20 minutes. At that point, I didn't even want the food anymore, so I just left. I wasted an hour of my day just for nothing. I ended up getting Chick-fil-A and got it within 4 minutes. I recommend you to not waste your time. I also recommend you to never go here, unless you want to have a bad day and be hungry. Anyways, this place sucks, never going here again. Plus, they have really bad service, every time I go here they always forget something. Either a fork or a spoon, or even a whole soup. Go enjoy your day at Chick-fil-A, not at this terrible Panera bread that I abhor."

They willfully did not take my order, and by the time the vehicle in front of me got their order and left, as I passed all the employees are standing around huddled in the middle of the floor doing nothing. This is a very prevalent attitude amongst young employees at various restaurants in the Waverly community. It is most unfortunate these damaging attitudes & behavior exist and seems to be thriving in the 21st century. #Panera Bread hold your employees accountable.

I've had to wait long times for my order to be brought to me. I've dealt with things running out and replacements having to be done which I understand. What I don't understand was my most recent experience. I decided to go in and pick up my order because I figured it would be quicker than waiting for them. When I went to grab my order it wasn't there. I had to wait to find an employee since I wasn't acknowledged at all. They seemed confused and almost made me feel like I was in the wrong. They had to ask other employees where my order was. When I told the employee my name again she responds \"oh we were out of Asiago that's why your order isn't there\" we stared at each other for a minute and I proceeded to ask \"well okay can I get something else\" she replied \"yeah go the front and they will get it\". The cashier I had to deal with was a very sassy rude man. Seemed almost annoyed to have to assist me. I gave my selections and he put it in bag and was going to send me on my way. I asked for the cream cheese that I ordered which then he seemed even more annoyed that he had to go and retrieve that. On top of all of that I had to ask him for a knife. I don't want to make assumptions but I'm getting a bagel and cream cheese, a knife would be helpful. Being annoyed with this whole experience I asked him is their anything they can offer for the inconvenience. He replies \"um no\" in which I responded \"really\". He then hits me with \"and what would you like me to do?\" In the most rude and snarky way. I grabbed my stuff and just left. This is unacceptable. I know places are short staffed but hiring just anyone is going to hurt your business. I do not ever want to deal with the rude people that were working that day ever again. Which is a shame because I work in the area and it was nice to have an option for lunch that used fresh ingredients. Shame on you Panera. Be better."

I ordered online and expected my food to be done once I got there (15 minutes after ordering a single bagel and a drink). I stood by the rapid pickup and watched the bag with my name on it sit on the counter as the staff stood around using very vulgar language and not doing anything. I finally asked if my food was done, and got a no- the plain bagel was not ready. After another few minutes of waiting, I watched as a man with no gloves dropped my sliced bagel into the bag- no box, nothing. Just loose in the bag, falling apart. It was depressing. Don't go here"

I asked the manager if it was a veggie sandwich that I had ordered , she said yes. but I told her the sandwich didn't look right. she said can refund me the money., but I told her that wasn't  necessary  A few dollars wasn't the point here, but the point was  she made a lousy sandwich .Also, she offered to re- make the sandwich ,  I turned it down because I didn't want her  spitting in my sandwich."

My kids told me the manager marched around tell people to put their masks back on as soon as their cup was empty or they sat their forks on the plate.
