She was very knowledgeable about the menu and events at Batchmaker. She recommended the Oreo Truffle cookie as one of her favorites and my husband thought  it was so delicious. I chose the Girl Scout cookie and it was okay. The coconut filling was very salty and each bite gave a different element of taste. Yanel's personality was so much better then past experiences here with staff. Being that she has only been with the company since November she has really taken the time to learn the menu and company as a whole. Because of her outstanding service we definitely will start coming back.\nBatchmaker you made a great employee hire with her. Please keep her! I can't wait to come back Saturday for the Cinnamon Rolls she raved about."

People were DELIGHTED by the desserts, raved about the oatmeal cream pie, s'mores brownies and cookies all night and have reminded me frequently since that day how much they loved the desserts. On top of the taste, the professionalism and kindness at the batch house is unmatched and a local business I beam with pride to support. High recommend batch house for your wedding dessert (and honestly daily sweet tooth) needs!"

They were also able to easily accommodate our need for some gluten-free options. We ended up ordering a cake, and a variety of mini's (brownies, cookies, and oatmeal cream pies). The cake looked amazing and tasted even better. The mini desserts were many of the guests favorite aspect of our wedding. The desserts here are just delicious, words can't do it justice, you have to go try for yourself! We would highly recommend the Batch House to anyone who appreciates a good dessert.

(FYI, they require orders for cakes at least one week in advance but can make accommodations if you need it sooner.) Anyways, I ordered it and brought it home. As soon as I sliced into the cake, I already knew it was going to be good.\n\nWhen I took the first bite, let me tell you, it was single-handedly the best tres leches cake I have ever had in my life. It was rich, creamy, decadent, moist--everything you could want in a tres leches cake. It's the kind of cake you have to lock up in a safe because every bite leaves you craving more. It was sweet but not overly so, striking the perfect balance--at least for me.\n\nI ended up paying $68.58 with taxes included. Some may think this is too much for a cake (like my mom), but at the end of the day, when it comes to cakes, I'd rather pay almost $70 for a high-quality cake and be satisfied than $20 for a low-quality one and be unsatisfied.\n\nP.S. I also got some miscellaneous items like their Oreo cookie, cinnamon coffee cake, and chocolate chip cookie with a chocolate bar in the middle. That cookie was insanely good; it easily ranks as the second best cookie I've ever had in my life--10/10 (I'm not even going to lie, if I had more of the Chocolate chip cookies, I would've eaten them all that night ). The Oreo cookie was a little too sweet for me--7/10, but the cinnamon coffee cake was good too--8/10.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place and will definitely be doing business with them in the future."

It was my wife's birthday and I had her day all planned out and losing my wallet would have ruined it completely! Thank the Lord Jesus Christ for answering prayer and using that sweet young lady. Now to the food, it was absolutely exceptional. Hands down the best bakery in the Charlotte metro area. My family got Oreo truffle cookie, chocolate pudding cookie, pumpkin s'mores, and the oatmeal cream pie (Some names maybe wrong) Each had its own unique favorite but all were so moist and delicious. My favorite was the pumpkin s'mores but would highly recommend them all. We'll definitely be back to support The Batch House and would like to say a special thank you to the young lady again for saving the day!"

Though The Batch House doesn't do conventional wedding cakes, we elected to order five different cakes -- and transport them across the state line (yes, they're really that good). All flavorful, fun, and moist, they were quickly devoured by our guests, many of whom made it their personal quest to try every flavor. The caterer had to wash extra cake plates mid-way through the reception because they had run out! Cris was such a delight to work with and the whole Batch House crew made our day that much more special."

However, the cookies were average.  We ordered a few of the speciality cookies and they really didn't have much flavor.  They were all decent but not better than some of the other local shops.\n\nThe thing that Batch House has on some of the other places is location.  Besides having a really unique and relaxed interior space, the outdoors is a shared space with lots of chairs, tables, fire pits, etc.  It's just a cool place to hangout.  It's a least worth visiting and hanging out for a bit."

It was so good we ordered it for our first anniversary again and it was just as wonderful! My hubby loves the OCPs and even more the rum raisin oatmeal cookies. We live over an hour away now, but can't wait to visit the new shop again and get some treats to save for a rainy day. Not only is Cris the sweetest human, her whole team is AWESOME!

I asked for the lava cake dessert and the worker started boxing up the display model that was sitting on the open counter (not behind glass) for everyone to hover over, sniff, touch, look at etc.  When I requested one from the back, the worker said there were no more and didn't see anything wrong with giving the unsanitary display item.  If this is the general attitude toward sanitation and health at this restaurant, I'd be concerned about what goes on behind the scenes."

I also noticed with the other hand she scratched her head without washing her hands. After changing out her glove, I ordered two slices of coffee cake, a brown sugar pop tart, and the s'mores brownie. I've had the coffee cake before. It was so moist and flavorful the first time I had it. Today, it was good but not great. The pop tart was meh and the brownie was too sweet for my liking and had a very hard bottom that I didn't like. I wanted to like this bakery but I wasn't impressed with it."

We had 5 cakes of different varieties and one that our florist added flowers to. They looked beautiful. We had over 600 bars and cookies and there was little left over. People raved about everything we had - smore brownies, lemon squares, caramel chocolate chunk, dirty brownies, bananas foster brownies, oatmeal cream pies, brown butter sugar, banana bread cake, chocolate cake, apple cake etc. Cris and the Batchmaker is a must try bakery and I'd highly recommend if you're looking for a fun, delicious dessert option for a large crowd."

Everything looked so good in the display case it was so hard to choose.\n\nThe strawberry poptart was calling my name so I answered back and boy what a great decision that was.  It was absolutely delicious!!!!  Pictures never do it justice but I would highly recommend a stop at The Batch House!!!!!  I'll be coming back to try those other yummy looking pastries in the display case!  Thank me later!"

I got an oatmeal cream pie and a chocolate peanut butter brownie. I started with the cookie, it was amazing. The next day I ate the brownie. Honestly probably the best brownie I've ever had. The brownie was thick, dense, fudgy in the middle with a flakey top and had a great balance of chocolate and peanut butter. The girl working the counter was very friendly and pleasant to talk to. Couldn't be happier. I'll be back for sure.\n\nOn a side note, to the person who gave a 3 star review, I think your reasoning for giving a 3 star review is unfair. You're upset because a place is popular and sold out of their product that is made fresh daily. It's your own fault. Don't go online and try to hurt a business because of your poor planning. Having to wait an hour for your treats because a business is popular and has a lot of customers is not a fault of theirs. I hope you're having a better day today than the day you wrote your review and attempted to hurt this fine establishments reputation."
