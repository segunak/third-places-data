            "review_text": "I recently visited Rhino Deli Market and had a mixed experience. The lady at the cashier was incredibly nice, and another gentleman who was there was also very respectful and friendly. They really made us feel welcome with their warm customer service.\n\nHowever, our interaction with the cook was less pleasant. We arrived to place our order at 7:55 PM, unaware that the kitchen was closing at 8:00 PM. As soon as we approached the cook, he seemed quite annoyed and said, \"Come on man, we close in 4 minutes.\" Although he did take our order after a minute of complaining, his attitude was noticeably different from the rest of the staff. When I returned to check if our food was ready, he responded with, \"Give me 1 minute, Bro!\"--again, not the most polite way to handle a customer.\n\nDespite this, the food was excellent, and the other staff members were great. However, customer service is key, and this experience with the cook stood out in contrast to the otherwise positive vibe of the deli. I hope the management can address this, as it would make the experience even better.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Rhino Deli Market for its great food and mostly wonderful staff, but there's definitely room for improvement in how all customers are treated."

He's the best--super kind, funny, and always makes us feel welcome. He remembers our names, greets us with a smile, and sends us off with well wishes every time.\n\nThe deli food is consistently delicious, but the grab-and-go chicken salad is next-level good!\n\nIf we had one small suggestion, it would be to see some domestic beers or seltzers on draft, since we're not craft beer folks. Draft kombucha would be a fantastic addition too.\n\nRhino Market is a gem in our neighborhood, and we're so glad to have it as our local go-to spot!"

First time I placed a pick up order, showed up to pick up order and was advised order had not been given to kitchen yet. Walked up front to inquire and said asked he advised it was wasn't ready as he rolled his eyes ( as though I bothered him) then proceeded to walk to back to drop off order.  Today, 4 tables outside Rhino market, 1 occupied by a homeless WM, 1 occupied by me (who purchased snacks from inside Rhino market) other three tables were BF and last table 2 WMs sitting not eating. The manager proceeds to walk outside and only address the two BF and say \"If you didn't buy the food from Rhino Market, you can't sit here and eat it\".  I explained although my food was not from Rhino, my drinks and candy, chips were.  He said well you can eat those items only.  He said to the other female ( who purchased nothing from Rhino) she could not sit there and eat.  But said nothing to the other two tables of WM, 1 homeless with nothing on his table, nor the other males who were just sitting and not patronizing the business."

This one is no different.\n\nWe found a few good options. We ended up getting a lemon blueberry white chocolate cookie and an ice cream sandwich. Both were great.\n\nThis is definitely a good place to come hang out for a while and grab something to eat."
