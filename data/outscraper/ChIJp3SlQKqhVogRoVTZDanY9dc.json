Her personal conversations bellow throughout the small space making it impossible to focus on any work or even relaxation for that matter. I tried to put in headphones and still could hear her through them. While I know she isn't intentionally doing so, I find that she is completely unaware of her surroundings and lacks respect for the customers. At one point I was here 7 days a week almost and this has certainly effected my want to come back. I could tell you every conversation she had... from her L'occitane body wash to her annoyances at the DMV and passport arrival times, I could write an entire essay on every conversation she had. I understand being quite at work may not be the most \"fun\" but when a great deal of people are working on things here, her lack of consideration for this is upsetting. I have left a 5 star review as I don't want this to affect the companies ratings, rather just a note for improvement."

Their artwork and the herbs they plant can be purchased- all proceeds go to the organization that supports these individuals.\n\nAll around amazing place with amazing people- best coffee shop I've ever been to!"

How much better can the outside be with it being the McGill's Rose Garden? It's just a perfect setting with the flowers and garden art. There is plenty of seating in the garden, including tables with benches as well as other seating scattered throughout. I was lucky enough to host friends and family at Rosie's to celebrate my daughter's high school graduation earlier this summer. The staff is amazing and accommodating. Everyone raved about what a great place it is. It's a little hidden gem right off Uptown and 277 and is well worth a visit. Parking is limited on-site but there's plenty just around the corner and within a quick walk. They also have cute cat swag. Just the best place to relax with a glass of wine or a cup of coffee."

Honestly, I'd go back for the coffee, not the wine. The atmosphere and ambiance made the wine bearable. I think anyone looking for a quiet spot to relax in the afternoon will find this place fits the bill. If you're looking for a place to hang with friends and take unique photos, you've got the right spot. They offer photography passes which I find to be a very unique way to finance the upkeep of the grounds (Fully support it). I'll definitely go back because I'm a garden lover."

Our barista Coco(?I believe that was her name, she was tall) was super-friendly, quick, and extra helpful. Naturally, the event had the staff busy, but the line was extra quick, even with the patrons lining up outside.\n\nAs a coffee fanatic, I definitely recommend the Berries & Creme they have as a special-- nice balance of sweetness and coffee.  My only \"complaint\", if you could call it that, was the baked goods selection was a little limited by the time we arrived, but with the amount of people they were accommodating, that's hardly their fault.\n\nTLDR; Definitely will be returning soon. Great coffee & alcohol worth more than they charge, and the entire garden is a vibe. Shout out to Coco, she's a rockstar. Try the Berries & Creme!"

They also have wine by the glass and bottle and a selection of beers and other beverages. I'm def going back for $5 wine night on Tuesdays!! I'm going back again regardless!

            "review_text": "The gardens themselves are beautiful! Atmosphere is is lovely.\n\nHowever, having an event here is not the easiest. I was not the one who was hosting, but my friend was. I helped her set everything up & brought everything in prior to guests arriving. When we got there the seats were dirty, they looked like they had mildew all over them. I asked if they could be wiped down and the manager Jason (I think) yelled to someone on staff \"Hey! Can you wipe the seats down again, apparently they're still dirty even though we already wiped them down\" I defended my ask by saying they looked like they were outside when it rained & I was able to flick dried whatever it was off of the chairs. I was also told they were stored inside- wrongo- they are stored in their outside storage pod- so yes, outside so they were mildewy.\n\nJason proceeded to tell me that they had them professionally assessed & they can't be cleaned anymore they are permanently  like that. Which tells me, they are permanently dirty.\n\nThen the catering arrived- which was some Publix deli looking sandwiches with no name cards so everyone had to guess what was in each sandwich. There was no cutlery, regular sized plates or the basic condiments that go with sandwiches. Then the wine that was previously selected for the menu was changed but no one informed the host. She found out by going to the bar to order wine & realized what she selected with the venue was not available so the event manager changed it to a wine that the host specifically asked to NOT have out.\n\nThe venue did not provide heating lamps, without a cost, although is a venue that is mostly outside. There was little to no light in the actual event space, the string lights & t-light candles can only do so much. The trash cans were full of trash from the last event, so we had to ask for them to be cleaned out.\n\nAs someone who works in the event & hospitality industry professionally, I might be a little picky. But my friend spent $750 + the required F&B min (which was over $1,000) on an experience that was not worth more than $500.\n\nWas honestly disappointed on how a venue that hosts small scaled events regularly presented themselves so rudely & obviously disorganized. Which is a shame because the venue space is lovely- its everything else surrounding that made the experience not pleasant."

It looks like they also host a yoga session on Friday mornings which I will absolutely be back to try. Our barista was also very sweet.

They had live music which we danced to around the firepit. We ordered pizza to be delivered and I bought a S'mores Kit!!!! Omg the best s'mores I've ever had. Thre energy was cool.

I deff recommend the red ones, specially the Malbec.\nThey set up the fire by our table and we enjoyed some dessert we had brought in. Staff members were attentive and welcoming.\nWe had a chance to walk around a bit and would love to see this place in daylight too."
