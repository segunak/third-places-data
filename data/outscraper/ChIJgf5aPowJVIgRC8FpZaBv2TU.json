Both ladies behind the counter acknowledged my presence but continued their conversation without offering any greeting.

On a positive note, the coffee I had was delicious, and the patriotic atmosphere was exceptional."

Some of the newer girls could use some customer service skills, but that's the only time I had an issue with my order and they fixed it right away.\nOverall pretty good place, gets crowded really fast so you gotta grab a seat when you find it.
