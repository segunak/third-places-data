Perfect place to study, the tables and chairs don't rock, there is sunny/shaddy/in-between seating so it's great for any day. Most people who come in bring dogs so just be aware of that. Some of the newer girls could use some customer service skills, but that's the only time I had an issue with my order and they fixed it right away.\nOverall pretty good place, gets crowded really fast so you gotta grab a seat when you find it. Proud to be a local patriot!"

Once I left and got up the road and started to drink the latte, it tasted like a cup of whole milk with very little Chai taste and gritty from not being mixed well.

It made me feel very comfortable and I did not feel as though I was an inconvenience like I have felt at many other coffee places.
