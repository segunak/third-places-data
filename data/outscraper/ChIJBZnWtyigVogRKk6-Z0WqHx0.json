Pretty typical French bakery stuff - a bit rich and sweet.\n\nHonestly, the food was good, but the real star was the atmosphere.

The cheese on the croque monsieur was not melted at all; it seemed like it was barely microwaved, and the ham looked like deli ham out of a local grocery store. (I did order it on GF bread, which should not actually impact the melting of cheese.) The coffee was just.. bad."

I had the turkey and bacon montecristo and a cappuccino. The coffee was OK, the sandwich was not up to par. Bacon was hardly cooked, way too much jam, cheese was pouring out of the sides. Quite sloppy. Taste was not great either. I did not try any pastries, so I cant speak to that. I spent $21 on the sandwich and coffee, hoping for something top notch, this is certainly not what I got. On top of all of this, what compelled me to leave a review was their customer service. Emily was the person at the counter who \"helped\" me, but made me feel extremely uncomfortable. She was rude and both times I went up to try to order she basically turned her back on me, leaving me to stand there looking out of place."
