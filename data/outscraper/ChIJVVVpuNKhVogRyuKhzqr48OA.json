Each bite was a delightful.\n\nWhat made my birthday breakfast even more special was when the staff surprised me with a birthday cookie! It was such a thoughtful gesture that made me feel extra loved and appreciated. The cookie itself was scrumptious, with a soft center and just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nThe ambiance of this breakfast spot is cozy and inviting. It's the kind of place where you can relax, enjoy your meal, and soak in the positive energy. The decor is charming, and the atmosphere is buzzing with positivity.\n\nI can't praise the staff enough for their exceptional service. They were attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to make my birthday breakfast unforgettable. Their genuine care and attention to detail truly made me feel special. A special shout-out to Adriana!\n\nI highly recommend this breakfast spot to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. Whether it's a special occasion or just a regular morning, you'll be treated to amazing food, outstanding service, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. I can't wait to go back and create more wonderful memories!\n\nThank you to the staff for making my birthday morning so incredibly special. You guys rock!"

            "review_text": "We honestly had no idea what this establishment was until partway through our meal, and even without knowing that we still would have left a rave. We are not from the Charlotte area, so we randomly found a highly rated restaurant to bring our family of four, and were impressed from the start. The place looks very stylish from the outdoor patio and upon entering, it just got prettier as we enjoyed the Christmas decor in the lounge area where we spent a few minutes during our short wait for a table. The staff were sweet with our two young kids, and sat us promptly in the posh yet warm dining area. Several TVs were hung high and each had a different classic Christmas movie on. The menu looked impressive and we were excited to order from not only the unique dishes but also the variety of sides and small plates. Our server was SO friendly and, as former servers ourselves, my husband and I could tell this guy was experienced and competent. He accommodated our split-tab for work travel, he offered to split a hot cocoa for our little ones and even made sure it wasn't too hot for them. At this point we still had no idea about any mission behind this restaurant, and once the food came it was all DELICIOUS so we were already starting to understand the many perfect reviews on google. The pulled pork Johnny cake had SO much flavor and just the right amount of ginger and spice. The New Orleans chicken sandwich was everything you'd want it to be and quite large. We also had the black garlic and Parmesan Brussels sprouts and, possibly my favorite, the honey hot sweet potatoes. Everything was notably tasty! Also, when our youngest spilled his hot cocoa another staff member took care of that mess and replacing it for us. She told us what the establishment was all about, and it was only then that we paid any attention to the name of the place I suppose having a 4 and 6 year old, at the end of a vacation, will do that to you Another lady also explained about the Christmas at the Cafe event, gave us vouchers for two free coffees/cocoas in the future, and she had made several stops at our table to play with the kids. It was a very supportive staff because we hadn't even noticed our server had taken a break until he came back until told us. He then explained much more about what they do for the community, and truly it's such a gift to meet people apart of an organization that provides such a valuable service to people in need. And more than that, the business is thoroughly impressive, they don't seem like a charity kitchen at all (which would be fine if they did)- the vibes were very up and up, very hip and on trend with flavors and atmosphere alike. Our experience would have been rave worthy even without their mission, but with that we felt especially compelled to follow through in writing that rave. But WHAT'S MORE... I left my car key in the restroom, and we drove back to the Raleigh area right away (using my husband's car key) I didn't realize until the next day, and they were ON IT, awaiting the call! The gentleman took down my mailing info right away and took care of the whole thing, mailing it to our home. We will DEFINITELY be coming back to Community Matters Cafe any time we are in the Charlotte area. Big thanks to these wonderful people and their mission."

The menu was concise and simple with both Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch options.\n\nI ordered the hot Cinnamon Bun Mocha and it was delicious! The cream on top was so good and it felt like I was having a dessert beverage. For Lunch I ordered the New Orleans Fried Chicken Sandwich with cheddar grits. I loved the cheesy grits and it was yummy. The chicken sandwich wasn't too spicy and it was straight fire!\n\nOverall, it was delicious and I totally recommend this restaurant if you are in the Uptown area of Charlotte, NC!"

We explained that we have not received our bill.  He said \"no problem, I'll take care of you\".  However, he never took care of us.  We were a little taken aback by the situation because he simply disappeared.  I went to the barista counter and explained the situation and she apologized profusely.  She was a wonderful person and even gave us a free coffee because we had explained we wanted to take a latte to go.  That was completely unexpected, but much appreciated after we felt like we were being kicked out.  I would have liked to speak to the FOH manager again, but he never did end up coming back to speak/assist us."

We had a nice spread of food that included French toast, cookies, chicken sandwich, salad and ricotta toast. Out of all the food and drink options the chai tea latte was out of this World delicious and flavorful. The ricotta toast was creamy and with some tartness from the tomatoes. I will definitely return again not just because of how great the food and drinks are but because it is very rare you get to eat at a place that is doing so much good in the community."

Coffee was smooth and easy to drink\nService was attentive but not suffocating.\nFood was fresh and tasty I tried their signature johnny cakes with pulled pork . I was apprehensive at 1st thinking it could be spicy but it wasn't it was so tasty and complex in flavors. My girl got the classic breakfast and was pleased.\n\nThe baked goods seemed a little underwhelming so we skipped that section\n\nThe mission statement for this cafe really warms your heart. We love food with a purpose and supporting local businesses that help the community like this one.\n\nCheck them out and be sure to go and support this amazing cause and get great eats in the process!"

Tho I'm partial to small and local businesses,  I have almost never had this kind of experience.  My partner and I walk into this breakfast spot and we were pleasantly surprised at the space this has. I did read the reviews and wanted in on the food that was soo raved about. Anyways. We get there and barely 2 tables are occupied.  We get promptly seated, get our bevs and that's about all we got for the 30/45 mins we sat awaiting food. Meanwhile, the restaurant starts to get busy and everyone who was after us get their meals. Even the last ones we saw sitting behind us. We had to flag down our server who was very casual about ' I'll go check in cuz things happen in the kitchen you know' and shrugs off never to be seen again! This was the 3rd time I flagged him down cuz the second was coffee refill. We left and wanted to pay for the bevs but the manager who when I was explaining what happened made me feel rushed to leave while looking around said our coffee and tea was on him. In the 10 mins of us waiting. Then leaving I never heard from the server or the manager not even when I waited outside for my partner to get the car.  I'm sure you're short staff but then that makes me think how did everyone else get their meals after you got busy? I have never made to feel soo dismissed and rushed. I can't think of any other reason but the very casual attire I was in - sweats and a hoodie while I saw everyone else all dressed for the day. Some of have a day off, too and like to be casual. Rest assured, we'll not be ever visiting here after a humiliating experience.  I guess I wasn't preppy looking enuf cuz I never found an actual dress code. Rr was clean and did smell good. I'm sorry at the whole meals being missed in your kitchen but it sure was not a pleasant experience for us by any means either."

Located in an old mill building, it is rich with history and ambiance.  The menu is simple, but delicious -- absolutely do NOT miss the Brussel Sprouts -- the best I've ever had.  Next time, I'm trying the Fried Chicken which looked amazing.  The staff -- CLIENTS (that's what they call them) of the Rescue Mission.  These men and women are fighting to start their lives over and CRM is providing them with the skills.  What a privilege to meet them and encourage them in their journey.\n\nThey have a meeting room for groups of 20.  They are open for breakfast and lunch only.  They have outdoor seating.  You may want to call ahead for reservations to avoid a wait or to get a good seat.  I'll be back again and I'm bringing folks with me.\n\nNot only will you get a top-level meal, but you are making a difference in the lives of important people who are on the upswing!  Don't miss it!"

The dish was delicious and filling, and the service was fast and very friendly. I highly recommend this place and am sure you would not be disappointed."

It was on the Yelp Charlotte Top 100 list and Best New Restaurants list in 2019, so clearly Yelpers know about it.\n\nFirst off, I love that they're supporting Charlotte Rescue Mission. It's great to find restaurants with a great cause like this!\n\nCovid-19: you can order and pay online. Pickup your food inside when you get there. They have a lot of outdoor seating, but it was crowded. We found a picnic table in the parking lot with no one else around.\n\nWe ordered the Pulled Pork Johnny Cake, Sugar Crusted French Toast, and the New Orleans Hot Chicken Sandwich with a side of Crispy Brussels Sprouts.\n\nEverything was fantastic. I think the french toast was my favorite and the best I've had. I love how crispy and caramelized the outside was and how light and fluffy the inside was.\n\nThe Pulled Pork Johnny Cake was so unique. I loved the flavor of the corn based pancake and the pulled pork/egg was the perfect addition on top.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was perfectly crispy and delicous. I will say it wasn't at all hot so the name was a bit of a misnomer to me, but we loved it nonetheless.\n\nWe also got some pastries. We enjoyed the miso blondie, lemon cheesecake cookie sammie, and the molasses cookie sammie. The molasses cookie sammie was my favorite.\n\nThe inside is beautiful too. It would be a great place to hang out and get work done post Covid.\n\nDon't make the mistake of sleeping on this place! Try them out for your next brunch."
