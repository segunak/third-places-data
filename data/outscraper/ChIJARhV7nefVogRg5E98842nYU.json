So yummy! They even give you a spatula (plastic) to cut the cake and candles. Perfect for any special occasion. We shared with a friend I had not seen in a while. I will be back to try other things as they also have breads and pastries! Great place!"

The beautiful entrance and modern, well-lit interior set the stage for an extraordinary experience the moment you walk in.\n\nAs you step inside, you're immediately greeted by a dazzling display of baked goods in well-lit cases. The sight is nothing short of mesmerizing, showcasing the bakery's incredible pastries and bread designs. It's clear that a significant amount of care and time goes into creating each intricate piece. The carving into the breads before baking results in exquisite designs that are truly a feast for the eyes once baked.\n\nThe attention to detail and craftsmanship in every item is evident, making it impossible not to admire the artistry on display. The baked goods are not only visually stunning but also mouth-wateringly delicious.\n\nMy wife and I were fascinated by our visit and were pleasantly surprised to discover such a high-quality bakery in Southpark. This bakery is now a must-visit for us whenever we are in the area for dinner. We can't wait to return for more delightful desserts.\n\nThank you so much to the Tous Les Jours team for an unforgettable experience. We look forward to many more visits!"

I told her she didn't have to give me an attitude and start moving her head. I just want my money that she owes me.\nShe turned around and said no, she didn't give me an attitude and accused me that i started it first. I told her no I didn't and I just want my money and IF she wasn't in such a rush to touch her phone and paid attention to the money I gave her then she wouldn't had messed up and I told her she needs customer service experience as she clearly DONT HAVE ANY.\nHow are you going to try to argue with a customer when YOU ARE CLEARLY in the wrong here?

I looked up and saw the title on the building and at a quick Google glance thought: \"coffee shop with donuts and stuff\" which actually was perfect in that simplicity. I walked in and was blown away by the array of colors and culinary treats. This meager line chef was suddenly a kid in a lego shop. The display cases just have to be seen and enjoyed in person even you dont do the whole \"food is art\" thing. Its the same joy of an ice creme shop with all the flavors except each flavor is an entirely different item. Willy Wonka music playing in your head and all that.  I had so many culinary questions and wanted to run around in their kitchen screaming \"wooooooooooooow neat\" but I sadly didn't have time and just didnt have out of state bail money.  Surgery was soon. The few things I grabbed would take longer than this thing will let me type to review. I'll just sum it up:  I will 100% make the 1 hour and some change drive  through a maze of school busses and SUVS to try new things in the future. I'm still drooling at the cakes on thier website.  Pink strawberry bread forever."

I'm pretty adventurous, and every one of the food items I have tried I did enjoy.\n\nThey have really good drinks, both hot or iced. Unfortunately- they took off the only caffeine free drink (that actually tastes good) off the menu. I ask about it every time I go, and I do go often & year round, but they just say \"it's seasonal\".  One time I went (this was a while ago), I asked about it again, and the barista who served me on that day told me that they honestly took it off the menu because it takes a lot of effort/ time to make. I told him that it was a bummer for me cause I can't have caffeine and that drink itself was the reason I started going to TLJ regularly in the first place. He said that he knew how to make it and offered to make it for me (it was slow at the time) which was super considerate. I told him not to worry about it because (I didn't want to be annoying) but I genuinely respect taking something off the menu for a reason like that.\n\nAll of the baristas and staff are super sweet and accommodating. I've tried all their caffeine free drinks and unfortunately none of them are to my personal taste, but they have always offered to change it or refund me. I appreciate the gesture, but I think part of going out to try new things comes with the risk that you might not like what you ordered."

Then she went to the lady who was preparing the cake on the corner and came back said \"No, only for the Holiday cakes\". The lady in the corner turned around and look at us bluntly and went back in preparing the cake. We were shocked for a $46 cake and for just a small topper they will treat us that way. To think on Thanksgiving Eve, we bought Ube Cloud Cake and they gave us the \"Give Thanks\" topper when we asked for it. And we always buy almost $200 everytime we go there since we are 30mins away from this place.  We like their cakes and pastries so we buy a lot everytime we are there. But, this time it seems that they are not in the mood to serve their customers. We are attaching photos of cakes that we bought these recent holidays, so that you'll see that their customer service are not consistent. Anyhow, we are not coming back!"

Turns out, she completely forgot and couldn't get her attention. The cashier did not ask for here or to go. We were waiting for our coffees and realized they had them sitting there without even calling it out. The lavender latte I did not finish because it was too sweet.  as for the bread cake in the bag, was not good either. the strawberry croissant was good though. The chocolate cloud was alright.  Definitely would check out other dessert places."
