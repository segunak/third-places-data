I don't know what it is but it's literally the best thing I've ever tasted. Their chocolate chip scone is mouthwateringly delicious. I've had chocolate chip scones elsewhere, and they've been nothing but disappointing (esp after having theirs).\n\nI'm moving soon & won't be 7 min away from here but you best believe I still will go out of my way to come here."

It was definitely strong, but I wish it had more flavor. Either way, it was very tasty, and I loved it. I ordered their spinach and Swiss quiche, which was DELICIOUS! & Only for $5, YES, PLEASE!

I got excited to see that the owners were mountaineers, (I am a mountaineer mom). Yet when ordering and initiating small chat in regards to such. They all seemed unbothered and could care less. It did take me by surprise that EVERYONE that worked there seemed miserable and unhappy .

So with that being said, we will just take our average of 75.00 week coffee house spending habit elsewhere. Here is a little note to Central Coffee ..Customers still do come first somewhere.

The guy who answered said thanks for letting him know. I might go back if they promise to make a full drink.\n\nUpdate: The owner reached out to me to rectify the situation and I appreciate that more than anything. That's good customer service which is so hard to come by these days. I will be back. Thank you."

I also went there when I needed to do research and enjoyed the coffee and atmosphere very much. I often met friends there and told many people how much I loved Central. They have great coffee, great staff and a fabulous rewards program. I earned many free cups of coffee. When the pandemic hit and they were shut down I really missed the wonderful coffee but found I could order it and have it delivered. Ever since I have enjoyed Central coffee at home and brew the dark roast most mornings. Once they reopened I have been using the Odeko app to order my coffee every Sunday. It is a pretty easy app to use and I can order it ahead of time and by the time I drive to pick up my coffee it is ready fairly quickly. Today I did just that and ended up waiting for over 30 minutes. Customers who came after I arrived and ordered their coffee in person walked out with their cup of joes and I was still standing there waiting. I was livid. I never write reviews but I needed to get this off my chest. I'd like to say I am never going back but I know that isn't the case. I just wish they could have a better system right now.  They also claim to be short staffed which I find hard to believe with the amount of people out of work. Come on CC you can do better!"

During a recent visit to Charlotte, I was happy to have found such a nice little coffee shop within walking distance of the Airbnb I stayed in. Walking is good for you, but it's even better when you know there's a great cup of coffee at your journey's end!\n\nThere was a line each morning I visited, but it moved quickly. Employees were quite friendly, and one even complimented my Dwight Schrute themed RSVLTS shirt! Engaging in genuine, worthwhile small talk is an art that needs to be revived. These folks get it! And this location is also a good spot to catch a Lyft if heading to other points in Charlotte.\n\nHope to come back soon and maybe spend some more time in the shop, soaking up a bit more of the Charlotte vibe!"

I assured her that yes, I bought a coffee and I just threw it away in the trash can.\n\nI don't write too many negative reviews but again, I do not recommend Central Coffee.
