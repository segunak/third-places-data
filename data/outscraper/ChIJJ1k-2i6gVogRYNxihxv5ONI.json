(I came 7/25/24 at 9:15am, if you want to tell the young guy with dark hair that took my order to get his ears checked). I absolutely hate vanilla. I tried it, and it tasted very fake, barely masking the hydrogenated soy bean oil in it. I tried a bit on the top, and it was so gross that I just threw it away. We ordered in, and my drink came in a to go cup, and my friend's came in an actual glass. There goes getting any actual cute photos. Make up your mind. My friend ordered a hot chocolate, which wasn't bad, albeit plain all things considered. My chai latte was gross. It had almost no spices in it, which is why I suspect they put a ton of cinnamon on top, to try and mask this. It basically just tasted of steamed milk, which is freaking gross. I live in a pretty small city, and there is WAY better chai lattes there than this place. Waste of money.\n\nAlso, do something about the ants on your patio that are eating your customers when they sit outside."

I truly enjoyed the overall atmosphere and vibe. The employees were very nice, and overall I loved it.\nDesserts;\nI had a few different ones and so did a business partner of mine who I was meeting up with and we enjoyed all of it.\nWe had\nChocolate Silk Tart 8/10 (no soggy bottom. Perfect. The chocolate custard reminded me of my mothers)\n*Tiramisu 8/10 (not dry at all. Perfectly soaked in coffee)\n*Creme Brulee 9/10 (they torched it fresh)\n*Salted caramel brownie 7/10 (you can tell caramel was cooked properly with how well it held up)\n*Banana Cream Tart 7/10 (no soggy bottom. Perfect)\n*Cheese Danish 7/10 ( could use more cream cheese but overall very flaky and good taste)\n\nOverall everything wasn't nastily sweet like you get with some american bakeries. Everything you could actually taste what they were made with and not just sugar.\n\nI really enjoyed it. She really enjoyed it. She went to the bathroom and stated they even had a secret code word for woman in case they are in trouble to discreetly tell employees. Very happy with that. Not a lot of places do that. Bathrooms were very clean and nice on the mens side."

Not smooth at all. Therefore, I gave it back and although they admitted it shouldn't be that way they didn't have any fresh ones to swap with because that whole entire batch came from the main store.

A \"large (diameter=3 inches)\" pecan tart is now 6.50 before tax. I would (maybe) agree to pay this price if the coffee section/baristas would be making it right and consistent. Still it became very, very expensive.\n\nI did not want to hate it. I just don't understand why should I pay so much for this kind of service (most of my complaints are regarding coffee quality). I know I can find another place but the location of this one is good for me. And it used to be better.\nPlease take some effort to educate baristas and improve the quality of coffee."

Today we got their lunch sandwiches and fruit tart. Lunch sandwiches are way over priced for what they have. They did not offer refill for my iced tea and fruit tart was average. On top of that their ambiance is not very \"calm, relax or charming\" it is more like chaos. They have some many pieces that does not match. Not my favorite.

They did refund our mo ey for the food but it was frustrating nonetheless. We never did try the food and probably never will. The staff we talked to about it were rude and blamed the backup on the kitchen staff. My girlfriend ordered a small tea and the tea was large but very weak. She asked for another tea bag and an employee took her over to the area where the tea bags were at the end of the bar and told her to pick out the tea she wanted, she even told her to try a couple different ones which was kind but then the guy making the coffee and drinks who said he was a manager told her \"Hey, what are you doing, you cant just take those.\" She explained to him that his employee told her to select a few and he said \"So.your just going to take them and walk out of here with them?\" and her reply was \"Yep!\"."

            "review_text": "On the way back to Soda City, my beautiful Daughter in Law asked if there were any French Bakeries nearby. (She speaks fluent French) So I whooped out my brain, iPhone, and did an extensive research. I came up with Amelies French Bakery that had a location near us and several others in Charlotte. I GPS'd to their Carmel location and put the emergency blinkers on as I waited outside while the crew were inside filling up boxes. When they came, I took pictures that looked pretty good. Little did I know my tongue hitting my head may cause a concussion when I took a taste of the first sample and I thought I was in France as they were so good!!! If you are looking for sickening sweet desserts, this is not for you. If you like European sweetness, Soda City can't compete!!! I knew something was up as I saw so many people coming out with boxes!!! The only error was my Son told them not to torch the top of his cream brulee. He said he wouldn't turn it down again."
