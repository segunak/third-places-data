HOWEVER, the music... awful. Why on earth while I'm eating the best sandwich I've ever had, do I have to listen to a cover of the jungle book soundtrack. Every other coffee shop I go to has a NORMAL playlist going with cute aesthetic songs that fit the coffee shops vibes, not this one. I guarantee that if you let any of the young employees behind the counter have control of the music then I wouldn't have to listen to the Muppets theme song while drinking my matcha (which is delicious btw). Don't even get me started on their Christmas time playlist... it's hard rock and heavy metal covers of classic Christmas songs (so it sounds like grandma is getting ran over by a reindeer in the middle of a mosh pit).  DO BETTER! (with love, its not hard to go on spotify and find a random coffee shop playlist that does not include a random French woman wailing like Yoko Ono)."

I had to ask many questions about GF alternative options before she finally said, \"I mean, we could put the sandwich toppings in a bowl\".\nThey had blocked most of the dining area's seating with a theater retractable rope. When I asked to free up four seats so that we could sit (because all other seating was taken), she said no because they had already cleaned that area. It was 1pm. They close at 4pm. I pushed the rope back 3 feet to open just enough seating for us. She sighed loudly! Then, she brought us the wrong food... in a bag because they didn't have any plates left. What?\nShe didn't belive me when I told her it was the wrong food, so I had to reopen my kids wrapped sandwiches and open the bread to show her.\nA family of five came in after us and they simply retracted the rope and sat. When one employee told them they couldn't sit there and she failed to get them to move, ANOTHER employee tried to kick them out of their seats! She also failed and was told she would simply need to clean the small area again. The rope was put back in place by the employee and retracted by the family about 5 times.\nThe service was a nightmare. Even though the food was okay, I'll never come back."

My husband and I went and waited 20 minutes after ordering pastries from the display. The staff filled orders from behind us before even starting ours. My husband provided feedback to the manager on their website and wrote a Google review as well (nothing rude, you can see it below). Upon reading the feedback from their website, the manager offered him a coupon and apologies, however once the manager saw his review on Google, he wrote back rescinding his apology and coupon and stated his staff was right. Shame on the management. This place could be a real asset to the community, but I will be taking my business elsewhere."

It's baffling how this place remains in business with such atrocious customer service.\n\nOn my first visit, I was completely ignored by the staff. I stood at the counter, clearly visible, while the employees were engrossed in their own chat, completely oblivious to my presence. After waiting far too long, I eventually left, feeling completely unacknowledged.\n\nDetermined to give them another chance, I returned for a second visit. This time, it was just as bad. The same two employees were once again engaged in their own conversation, and it took me speaking up before they even noticed I was there. When they finally did, their lack of professionalism was even more evident.\n\nI inquired about some pastries marked as 50% off in the case, only to be told by one of the staff members that they shouldn't even be on display. Without hesitation, she removed them from the case, tossed them in the trash, and walked away without offering any further assistance or even a basic apology.\n\nIt's incredible how Sunflower has managed to cultivate such a dismal customer service experience. Harrisburg is  a small community and I am an advocate  of supporting the local business in my backyard. Unfortunately, they will need to over haul their entire staff before I consider returning.  Save yourself the frustration and take your business elsewhere.\n\nDon't share sensitive info. Chats may be reviewed and used to train our models. Learn"

Ended up ordering from the app that is advertised on their front door since there was a long line. It all went down hill from there! The man working the cash register is a complete piece of work. I asked him where I should go to pick up my food, and he basically yelled at me for using he app and said he doesn't know it's a whole different system. I asked well is there like a shelf where you put to go orders when they're ready and he points at something behind his counter so indeed I do need to ask him for my food when it is ready. Im not sure why he had such an attitude. I also watched another cashier take a table the wrong type of muffin, then take it back and bring the right flavor and the look on her face. Well, I guess no one likes working here or serving customers. Ahh well won't be back. P.s. $10 for a breakfast sandwich served with a terrible attitude too much. My dad ended up waiting inside for the food and I went to the car with my son but he was also rude and mean to my dad."

Josie informed me after I ordered that the tropical coconut tea was out of stock.  :( of course I was super bummed but Josie made the experience that much better by pivoting and offering me a different beverage of my choice.  She was apologetic, polite, and soft spoken.  Great customer service should never be overlooked and I just wanted to make sure that Josie was recognized for going above and beyond.

It is not made consistently every time I get it which is mostly Sundays at lunch time and we always get it to go.  The cranberry apple chutney is the star but sometimes there is barely any on it so you can't even taste it and the sandwich is very dry without a decent portion of it.  With this sandwich being $10 with tax please don't jip your customers on the ingredients.  Also it's supposed to come with a pickle spear on the side but they hardly ever include it even if we remind them when we place order they still leave it out. Again $10 sandwich, please give your customers the pickle that is supposed to be included per your menu.  Love this place and everything they make, just get disappointed and frustrated when it doesn't live up to the quality that I have had in the past."

Then when I greeted her she kept her back to me and mumbled hello begrudgingly. Wow. So, I asked her what gf items she had left and once again with her back towards me she briefly stated what they had without even pointing them out to me. Honestly, it felt very racially motivated. I don't say that often, but she CLEARLY had a problem with me even tho I just walked into the store. I just couldn't bring myself to purchase anything after being made to feel so UNWELCOMED! (I was there around 4:15pm on a Tuesday...and i will never return)"

I find this very unsanitary. Bacon on both sandwiches was crumbles of burnt bacon that was not fresh. Husbands croissant over toasted as well. Sandwiches came out before can of coke and iced latte. Never brought my cookie out had to go to counter and ask. The one ketchup bottle in the restaurant was empty. Husband waited at the counter to ask for a new one, got ignored.  Overall restaurant service not good, food not good and WAY overpriced for what it is. I am a local so to have tried this place multiple times over the years and it's the same level of disappointment each time. I don't think it's hard to make a fresh breakfast sandwich and give someone their drink before their food. Or at least with their food. Won't be coming back.\n2 stars only bc cookie and iced latte tasted good."

At the other location, I overheard the manager telling a new hire how important it is to get the foam right. And that standard is upheld by their staff every time I go in there.\n\nThey're much more friendly as well at the 7th street store. I don't need overly chipper or phony staff, but at least be polite. At Harrisburg they are kind of unwelcoming and cold.\n\nAlso, they have you waiting for no reason and pick and choose who to prioritize, and because they hate having to speak to you, they don't communicate anything.\n\nI ordered a soy latte and a pastry while I was the only person inside. Right after I ordered and tipped, several people came in, and they were all taken care of while I stood there empty handed. I have my theories as to why i was disregarded and thrown on the backburner for those other customers. The guy who took my order kept looking at me then dashes to the back and took a long cake order over the phone. He asked me about 15 minutes later if i had gotten my drink yet when he could clearly see that i didn't have anything in my hands resembling a pastry bag or a coffee cup. So then he asked another employee to make my drink and she was clearly irritated by this request. She messed around for several minutes before picking up the cup he marked for me and begrudgingly making my drink. Of course after all that, she sat the drink next to the register without saying anything, and the milk in my latte was scorched and without foam. Shots tasted weak too. The Pastry was very good though.\n\nI'm good on this particular location. It's trash. I'd rather just go 2 more minutes up the road to the Starbucks."

And 30 minutes later when they still didn't have it, they told me the same thing.\n\nWatched someone else ask for a refund, in the meantime, because they couldn't wait any longer for their order. And then watched another customer who'd just received their food complain about having to wait 45 minutes for their sandwich. And then watched a little boy who was there with his mom go to the counter because he'd been waiting almost an hour for his food.\n\nAsked for a refund for our order at the one hour mark, and suddenly had food in my hands five minutes later, because the front counter folk asked them (AGAIN) to make my order immediately. Two basic sandwiches and two coffees. We did get our coffees quickly when we initially ordered, to be fair. But that's all we'd ordered. Nothing complicated. Not a huge quantity. Nothing with customizations. Basic and simple. And the food was great, no doubt.\n\nIt was also wrong.  After all that waiting, they made me the wrong damn sandwhich. And since we'd said we couldn't wait around any longer, please wrap it up to go, I didn't find out til I was in the car Unfortunately, no way was I going back in for them to correct it; I'd never eat.\n\nThe amount of time it took to get my food for both visits was awful. It's clearly not just a once in a while, they're busy, sort of thing. They're slow, they're inattentive to the tickets they have in the window and how long those tickets have been in the window for, and they're not worth it.\n\nWon't go here again and would advise not stopping in unless you have an hour or so to kill."

The coffee was a bit different for my taste but tastes good. There is something missing tho and we can't pin point exactly what. Oh also ordered the cheddar biscuit and that was good too. Worth a try definately. Would I go back? Maybe yes.."

I've passed by this place for years, (even when it was under different management) and I've always looked over in a kid-like curiosity like, \"One day...\" Today was the day!!! Egg, spinach, tomato, provolone and turkey on and a cheese biscuit! I am not really the one for egg sandwiches, or writing reviews, but this one was a MUST! This sandwich is a must!!! I personally wouldn't do it without turkey, but to each his own, just ENJOY! This sandwich was not seasonal, so I will be back! And I absolutely love and adore the \"Sunflower\" decor!"

The tea was EXCELLENT! The ginger cookie was really good too, made with real ginger. Absolutely going back.\nUpdate:  Went back and experienced similar long wait time with very few customers.   The one young lady behind the counter was not pleasant. She wasn't mean, just no 'you're welcome, hello, etc. Now that I've read other reviews from this and the other locations,  I see this is the norm. Great food, a plethora of tasty drink and food choices, but not so welcoming staff and poorly managed.  Food service has to be managed well or no matter how good the food is, it will eventually fail. Food must be ordered so you can replenish before running out, online orders that include items not available  should be paused so the customer can be contacted.   Most importantly,  hire enough qualified staff for each shift. I will be going back and hoping for a better customer service experience.  Now after all of these reviews with the same complaint, let's see if the owner cares enough to address it and change."

Get to shop and paid at 927am. Sat and watched countless Togo orders leave before mine. Even more upsetting saw 4 sandwich orders that was placed in house long after I paid, get made and served before I received my order. Didn't leave with my order until 945am. Not sure how they prioritize the sequence of making orders but it definitely needs to be revisited. To put the cherry on top, made it to work 5mins after leaving only to realize they probably left my sandwich in the toaster the whole time I was waiting. Def not enjoying this burnt toast smh."
