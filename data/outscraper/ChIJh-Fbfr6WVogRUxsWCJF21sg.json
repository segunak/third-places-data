I would say perhaps 75% of the garden was not weeded - and the weeds in many areas were larger than the specimen plants.  This was made more surprising by the fact that the botanical garden isn't even that large... I could have probably weeded it myself in less than a week.  Many of the weeds had clearly been there all summer.  Inside the orchid house someone was doing some minor plant work, and the green waste was scattered around on the concrete walk - like the person couldn't be bothered to carry a bucket with them.  Trees and bushes poorly maintained - some had been planted too closely together and had died back, and the dead tree had been removed - leaving a stump and a huge hole in the landscape.  Visible rust on iron work in many places.  Chipped/old paint.  Who manages their volunteer groups?  Do they have any?  I was so shocked I even went to their web site to check their staff - and they seem to have a full time staff of 10 horticulturalists.  Do they walk the grounds?  My daughter had recommended the visit and spent the entire time apologizing."

The light displays were great, lots of neat effects on the plants and trees in the gardens. It was a relaxing walk and well organized so we didn't get lost. We would definitely try this again sometime."

            "review_text": "I really hate writing negative reviews on places but after the unprofessionalism i encountered i have to let anyone looking to book anything here to know what to expect. I recently booked an \"Engagement Package\" here to do a small proposal to my girlfriend and was not communicated properly about what this actually includes. To start things off the first location they were tying to set me up in was in the corner of this \"garden\" which wasn't even a garden it looked like someones backyard with no flowers no decor nothing it was just tucked away next to some bushes so i requested to be moved in to the conservatory which there was no problem in doing so. Why recommend someone a corner to begin with is beyond me. Anyways, here is when it gets even better, on their website they advertise the package as \"Proposal setup with floral decor\" which is not the case, all you get in reality is the lettering. No flowers not even the candles because it was not even offered until i asked about the setup to the planner helping me out who's name was Monica. I sent her a picture of the \"setup\" they have advertised on their website saying if i can have something similar to it and she proceeds to tell me that \"Thats an older picture and we no longer include as many flowers to make it more affordable\" and heres the kicker she said if i wanted to bring flowers on my own and decorate that i could, ending it off with a smiley face, and this is why it bothered me so much, I MENTIONED THAT I WAS DRIVING DOWN FROM NY THE DAY PRIOR, WHEN WOULD I HAVE HAD TIME TO DO THIS?! I even told her that i don't even need the 2 hours, all i needed was 30 min to 1 hour to propose and that i could've been compensated that extra time with more decor. To not even try to work something out in any way is how you get negative reviews like this one. None of this was ever communicated to me prior to payment nor is it advertised anywhere on their website that the setup doesn't include as many flowers as before which i can see why, because who would want to just pay for letters which aren't even that nice to begin with. False advertisement is what it is. Such a huge let down, i should have looked at the most recent reviews beforehand. Maybe it use to be nicer i guess but what kind of customer service is this. Now i have to think of something else i can do within 3 days. Thanks for nothing, do better."

I remain optimistic about their future, although having a general ticket price nearly on par with far larger and more established botanical gardens in other regions may dampen the appeal for some locals. Concessions around the garden are a nice touch but also expensive."

            "review_text": "Something truly special and stunningly majestic! This place exceeded my expectations and I'm still overjoyed after seeing a lush green and colorful array of flora as if Persephone herself was there tending the land. Walking through the Pergola's onto the succession of spectacular gardens, I was in complete wonderment. The Canal Garden was overflowing with fragrant blossoms and foxgloves lined the pathway as water features and fountains unfolded along the way. I admired an abundance of wonderful plants and sculptures strategically placed throughout in a vivid design. To my surprise, I noticed many plant species that I had never heard of or seen before, forever learning something new. The Orchid Conservatory with the waterfall wall was amazing. (I've always admired glass garden conservatories like the ones found in the US Botanical Garden in DC, Vizcaya Museum in Miami and Isabell Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.) And if you are an orchid and tropical plant lover, as I am, the conservatory is a must see. The White Garden reminded me of a secret English garden tucked away for tranquility. The children's area called, Lost Hollow, was crazy good. They had a mini amphitheater that reminded me of my visit to Ephesus last year where a reenactment of Cleopatra and Ceasar (or Mark Antony) was held. The childrens area also had a magical/enchanted Fae/Faery like area where you can play in little forest dwellings and king and queen stone carved throne chairs with views of walking trails below. There is so much to see and do here. You can't get bored here. There is so much to learn and explore or just unwind or have a romantic outing. In comparison to my favorite garden, Dallas Arboretum & Garden, I love North Carolina's tree-lined landscape that added a wilderness and untamed backdrop to the garden, giving it a balanced elegantly manicured but not overly groomed appeal. Sometimes it's attractive to be slightly wild and rough around the edges, checkout the wildflowers in the prairie area. As a bonus, this place offers garden classes and workshops, summer camps for children, opportunities for private events, and has two stores (including a gift shop). Special thank you to the lady who welcomed me in and explained the map and noticed I might do a little work and pointed out great shaded spots for working. (She lovingly expressed for me not to work too hard...much appreciated.) Many thanks to the Boards, donors, and staff for the great work here."

The \"orchid observatory\" was upsetting to say the least. There was not special or creative about this space to have such a title. Walmart has a better \"observatory\" of orchids. Very disappointing. Save your money and go to free park."

Instead of vibrant blooms and manicured landscapes, we were greeted by a disappointing display of neglect.\n\nOvergrown and Unkempt:  Weeds ran rampant throughout the gardens, choking out any semblance of flowers or well-maintained plant life. Dead plants hung limply, and the whole place had a neglected feel.  The sight of a large blacksnake slithering amongst the weeds only added to the unsettling atmosphere.\n\nWater Woes: The ponds, what should have been a beautiful focal point, were covered in a thick layer of algae.  The presence of dead mice and frogs floating on the surface was not exactly picturesque.\n\nUnderwhelming Exhibit:  The \"exhibit\" was a total dud. It felt more like a high school student's hastily thrown together extra credit project, and not one that deserved any praise.\n\nPricey Neglect:  Charging an admission fee, especially the hefty $14.95 per person, is outrageous considering the state of the gardens.   Being overcharged for an extra person only added insult to injury.\n\nSave your money and your time!  Skip Daniel Stowe Botanical Gardens until they get their act together. There are plenty of other places where you can enjoy beautiful, well-maintained gardens for a fraction of the price."

Listed as number 8 of things to do in Charlotte, posted by travel us news, I couldn't wait to visit. What a shock! Instead of seeing beautiful orchids, flowers, plants, etc. I saw a lot of dead, overgrown, under watered and unkempt gardens! Unfortunately, the weeds have taken over everywhere! Dead branches were hanging loosely in trees. The Wings Exhibit was closed and didn't show any signs of opening anytime soon. A mound of mulch waiting to be spread. There were a couple of employees, one riding on a tractor and the other riding on a cart. However, I never saw anyone tending to the gardens. The employee at the front door, who was working the cash register, was nice.\n\nNot sure if it's a lack of employees. However, I would think management would do something about these unloved gardens! At this time, I'm sorry that I wasted my money and time to visit DSBG!"

            "review_text": "Something is amiss here as the experience we had and what we saw DO NOT MATCH the reviews we're seeing! A recent visit told an entirely different story from the collected reviews on Google...\n\nDSBG was once a beautiful gem and on a path to being a standout in the USA. What has happened?\n\nAt first when we arrived, things were looking pretty good. They've put in a new trail system and the entry road and wine-cabin thing looked inviting. Plantings by the lake are pretty and the first impression was positive.\n\nPulling into the main parking lot however, it was clear that things were not so great. Weeds were everywhere, poking through the pavement and walkways, formal hedges hadn't been trimmed last season (or arguably in a couple of years) and were dominated by dead tips and unmaintained ground bed plantings (despite the spring daffodils pushing up all over the place) were the dominant feature and a gloomy sense of \"poor maintenance\" or budget issues abounded. Inside the main building, we saw chipped, dirty paint, outdated signage/brochures and handouts and our mention of scalding water in the women's bathroom, when reported to staff, was responded to with a defeated, \"we've told maintenance about it over and over.\" Supplies, chairs and event tables were stored haphazardly and in public view.\n\nThe main gardens were not better. BY FAR, the dominant species in the formal planted areas was grass and weeds. Sure, we were there during a shoulder season but the sheer number of freeze-damaged, absent or otherwise just dead plants was shocking. I saw many identifying marker signs for signature plants that were either dead, physically damaged or just not there. The base and structural plantings (hedging/trees/backgrounds) had obviously not been well maintained over the past few years and just by glancing around, it was clear that neither had the trellises, buildings, pergolas and pathways. Even the fountains showed signs that they hadn't been adjusted (or cleaned out) in at least 3 years! Loved the tattered chlorine feeders sitting where toddlers could easily get to them...\n\nUgly, disorganized infrastructure from holiday event activities litters the landscape and the poorly marked \"improvement projects\" currently underway look to be \"low bidder\" or minimal works - lipstick on a pig. Honestly, a visit to ANY public park, in ANY town (maintained by a local government with minimal resources) would have been a better use of our time than our visit to DSBG.\n\nI frankly saw more spring blooms along the highway and in my own yard!\n\nOh, and the \"Orchid Sanctuary.\" Just wow. It's clear that a failure of the heating system or a major staff problem has happened. 75% of the tropicals in the building showed signs of cold damage or were already totally dead. ALL of the signature orchids had died (except 2 tiny specimens) and their answer was clearly to go to the local garden center, buy $300 of potted orchids and zip-tie them IN THEIR GROWERS POTS randomly around the building. A little moss was evidently used to try and cover up the pots but price tags and bar-codes were still on many of them! All still had their stem stakes and greenhouse clips on the flower stalks and were still in the shipping medium!\n\nOn the way out, a stop at the cabin/wine and picnic operation was a disappointment too... While the concessionaire is obviously trying with wine sales, it's a bit disconcerting to look at the food offerings and find rotten \"fresh fruit\" in clamshells and sandwiches/wraps days past their expiration date on display in the coolers.\n\nFor me, there is a clear reason. Leadership. Sure, their past interim director went to prison for drugs but DSBG HAS A MASTER PLAN AND AN ENDOWMENT to build and operate this place! Letting the garden dwindle, fall apart and \"go to seed\" like this is an embarrassment to the region. This is clearly poor execution on the part of leadership.\n\nAn actual treasure here is being destroyed by neglect, poor volunteer leadership and lost vision. Someone needs to CARE."

While we did enjoy it I will say it was a bit confusing. No map is provided and you aren't given any direction as to where to go. It's also quite dark and hard to see the walkways at times. Everything looks great and the staff we did encounter were very nice. But it would have been nice if there were dim lights along the path to see where you're going. Beautiful lights and plenty to look at. There's also a stand with hot chocolate and other drinks towards the back and you can sit by a fire pit  to warm up. Another issue we had is getting to the main entrance. Our GPS brought us to the back entrance for deliveries only and we had to figure out how to get to the front. There is no signage pointing the way and from the road the main entrance is a ways away. If you go to the back enteance, go back out go the road and tien right, you'll get there down the road. Other than that we did enjoy."

Surprisingly emotional for such a simple and elegant presentation.

I loved that we were able to pick from a book of pictures to paint. The teacher was very friendly and gave us tips along the way to create our masterpiece.

Areas were dried out, and just not flourishing. You can see parts where they were flowers, and they're beautiful, but I felt like they asked too much money for the experience."

My own yard is a certified wildlife habitat with open areas and woodland. I have decades of experience so I know my plants, most annuals and perennials, flowers and herbs of mine are grown from seed or tuber. This looks too much like the work of a property landscape company with a big budget and a very nice greenhouse to store the tropicals they buy.  Might be good for someone who lives in an apartment. Anyone else will be underwhelmed. Some areas are poorly tended to, and were more like just patches of weeds. No nurturing went on in these gardens, just a money grab."
