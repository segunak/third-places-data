We were so glad that they were open.  I enjoyed the best Green tea Matcha latte made by Sama.  She was so kind and generous.  She was able to customize it by adding mint flavor.  I spoke to her at the end of the night and complimented the tea.  I mentioned how much for a refill, and she bless my heart and gave up her complementary shift drink. She truly was such a blessing.   It is always nice to meet kind, hard-working, workers, at coffee shops, who love their job.   Hats off to the kind young man who worked at the register last night because he was so very patient as we were trying to figure out our order. Love this place!\n"

I ordered a cappuccino, but I received a shot of espresso instead. Not a big deal, though, the waffle sundae more than made up for it! It was absolutely delicious--crispy, warm, and topped with just the right amount of sweetness. My wife really enjoyed her latte, which was perfectly balanced, and my son had a blast with the brownie sundae. He couldn't stop raving about it! Overall, the desserts were the highlight of our visit. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area! We'll be back for sure the next time we are through the area."

Making it seem like i was wrong and crazy . In this reply you mentioned beans . You guys lied . Someone lied to me ... you never use to use a concentrate because I watched you make my drink . Now it's all white , and sweet . Disgustingly sweet . I'm confused . Was the owner trying to make excuse for the baristas ? Or were you trying something new ? I use to buy the beans you used with the drinks !  Something isn't right ... just like the concentrate they put in my drink !\n\nlove percentile , but first time in 6-7 years , the berries didn't taste like the berries .

Initially, I used to come here alone, but now I bring everyone along - my coworkers, mall management, my roommate, friends, and even my boyfriend. I visit multiple times a day, and I have no regrets!\n\nThe atmosphere here is amazing, and the place is always spotlessly clean. The baristas and owners are some of the friendliest and sweetest people you'll ever meet. They make everyone feel welcome and part of the community.\n\nI've even made some wonderful friends here, with Abby being one of the best. The strong AC and Wi-Fi make it a perfect place to hang out, work, or just relax. The other regulars are also fantastic and add to the welcoming vibe of the place.\n\nOne of the highlights is their summer menu, which features a latte that has become my all-time favorite. I honestly can't get enough of it - if it's not coffee from here, I don't want it!\n\nThey host a variety of events like bingo nights, karaoke nights, classes, and there's an upcoming trivia night that I can't wait to check out. Their Instagram content is hilarious and keeps me entertained between visits.\n\nI've even started collecting their merchandise - so far, I have a t-shirt and a mug, but I'm definitely planning to get more.\n\nThis place is also great for groups. Sometimes I come alone, but other times I host a small Bible study here, and it's always the perfect setting.\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic coffee/ice cream shop with a welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff, great events, and a wonderful community, this is the place to be. Highly recommend!"

The staff walked past the counter several times without any acknowledgement what so ever. There were 3 staff behind the counter. After we stood there for a good while, enough to realize they weren't gonna wait on us, I said excuse me, the girl turned around and said \"yeah?\". So rude. She wasn't very helpful at all. She replied with a sarcastic response. I felt upset and not appreciated or valued as a customer in their establishment. Will not be back, which is a shame because it looks like they sell some pretty great stuff, but based on how I was treated, I don't plan on finding out."

I used to enjoy visiting.\nIt has gone a little downhill. Tables are wobbly, they're very understaffed, and tables are not wiped up. They've added a kiosk for ordering, but it doesn't help much if they have a large menu and only 2 to 3 people behind the counter.

I don't think 'fill half the cup with water' is confusing. When I tried to explain to them that they can just empty half the cup and put another shot in they exclaimed to be very confused as if I was speaking another language.

Perc also offers Jags Head, and while I don't prefer their proprietary blend, I LOVE the coffee from their Finca el Cipres farm; it's one of my favorite roasts available in the Charlotte area. Furthermore, Perc offers excellent traditional espresso drinks as well as deliciously creative crafts, even letting the baristas have a say in creations.\n\nHowever, there are still some qualms I have with the shop. Most notably, I wish the owner would focus more of his energy on doing coffee EXTREMELY well; I don't understand the eclectic assortment of random goods spews across the shop, and I doubt it turns enough of a profit to warrant the space it takes up. No one comes to perc for soap, pasta, popcorn, or lotion, so quit pouring resources into those things. I get it: Sean wants to support local businesses, and I do too! But support local businesses that are in/complimenting your industry. The daily pastries and truffles are great.\n\nUltimately, there's a reason I come back every once in a while. The owner knows what he's doing, but he'd still benefit from sitting down and acting upon what his staff and loyal customer base have to say."

Besides, I also ordered a cinnamon roll that tasted very homemade and of course delicious  but what I liked the most was my matcha latte with white chocolate and lavender, it's one of THE BEST matchas I've ever taken, you can tell that they did it with a lot of love \n\nThe place is beautifully decorated not only with chairs but armchairs and a cool couch, they have other drink options ready to go and merchandise such as mugs, hoodies and very nice shirts \n\nVery good sanitation score, good variety on the menu and super attentive, kind and extremely friendly staff \n\nVery very recommended "

I visited today with my elderly aunt who has Parkinson's and my very active 6 year old on 6/6/2023 around 4pm-ish. I wish I would have caught her name but the young lady who helped us delivered premium service! She was so patient and so kind. She allowed me to get my daughter and aunt situated before I went back to choose and pay for my items. She answered every question I had and then some.\n\nWe loved the ice cream! My aunt is an ice cream connoisseur and worked at our local creamery back home for years. She was very impressed!\n\nI brought home a couple apple pie cronuts for my mom and husband and they devoured those as well. My mom said the best part was pulling the flakey layers at each bite!\n\nThis was such a fantastic experience! Percantile and Creamery you have certainly set the bar high for your competitors!"

Make sure to ask for the waffle to be warmed up. Our favorite flavor so far was the White Chocolate Raspberry ice cream. They don't make their own ice cream, but Tillamook is pretty good.\n\nThe service is usually a bit slow, but I don't mind waiting. The only real problem we've had is that the last time we went, we sat outside on their patio (like we had the previous times). They give you a number and bring your order to you. On this occasion, we waited quite a while, so we went inside to check on it.\n\nUpon doing so, they told us they didn't know where we were, so they didn't bring the food. They then handed us a cold waffle with completely melted ice cream. This wasn't ideal to me since we were sitting on their patio, but I guess we'll just wait for our food inside from now on."

The ice cream favors are white chocolate raspberry and rocky road. They were rich and creamy. The latte is rich with dark chocolate flavor and an infusion of Cayenne pepper powder. The prices were reasonable. The service was attentive. We were satisfied customers and will come back when we pass through Concord in the future."

I love the indoor space and outdoor tables. They also have cute merchandise frm t-shirts, to mugs, to mini succulent plants. Truly, you are an excellent edition to the neighborhood. Definitely a must try whenever around the area or in Concord Mills Mall or on a cute lil date nite. "

They get kronuts from Sugarrmann daily that sell out quick because they are so amazing ! Prices are good portions are really good.

This is in the Concord Mills area so traffic can get bad sometimes so keep that in mind when going."

We decided to stop for breakfast someplace local to theater and this was it. Very happy we did! Super cute place!  My mother in law and I both had there egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. My husband and youngest daughter each had kronuts and the birthday girl had a Belgian waffle and their calico latte. She was in heaven! She made me take a sip and it was very good. We left bellies full hopeful to return one day. That we did just last month. We had family in town from NJ and felt like coffees and dessert were needed after our day at great wolf lodge. I was finally able to order my own calico latte and my cousin ordered their cats pajamas sundae and we were all in awe. Still surprised he finished it all. Every person was happy with their selections and also thought this was a very cute place. We'll be back!"
