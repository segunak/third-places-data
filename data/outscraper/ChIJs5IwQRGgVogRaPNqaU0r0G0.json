It was without a doubt a great experience in every way! There was ZERO smell. It was SUPER clean. Like no cat hair anywhere!  I had no allergy reactions at all. The cafe is decorated so quirky and yet so aesthetically pleasing. I had the apple crisp latte and my daughter had the honey lavender. Both were soooooo good (thanks Julia!). Staff was friendly and engaged with customers and cats but not over the top. The cats were friendly and the cat room was spacious. If I were a cat I'd want to go there and hang out. The focus on adoption and the love they all have for rescues and for the cats is intentional. And I  felt  that in every  part of this cafe. It was a great experience and I will absolutely be back!"

My partner was told that any watering eyes or sneezing is normal for kittens as they adjust, but within days this developed into a cold. His kitten now has red watery eyes and tons of sneezes.Usually, this is not a problem as most organizations will offer a low cost visit at an affiliated clinic and help the kitten they just adopted. However, after paying $140 for an adoption fee, which is steep and more than I've ever paid for my healthy humane society cats, they essentially told him to go find his own vet after a WEEK from his adoption date. Like I said before, the baby's eyes were watery the DAY AFTER he got the kitten and they did not take the situation seriously. Just be warned that this organization facilitates over priced adoptions under the guise that the cats have been vetted but really they have been given shots, months prior, and they have no idea on the kittens current condition! Save yourself the $70-90 and just head down to the humane society where they will actually vet your pet and provide you with medicine if they are sick."

One employee told us we could enter if we had a reservation and then another employee asked us why we entered without checking in LOL, then right before the hour is up the coldly ask you to leave so the next party can enter. Not a big deal, it was super clean, fun, and a good time but nicer, warmer hosts/ employees would make this a 5 star coffee / cat shop."

I'm not a cat person but a friend of mine was, but despite not being a cat person, I didn't think it disappointed. There is a small cafe section to buy drinks and etc, but you do not have to buy anything to go into the cat lounge. The cat lounge costs $10 and a reservation slot is required. We didn't know this but we walked in and were able to go in after ~30 minutes.\n\nThese cats are up for adoption so basically if you like a certain cat you can adopt it, I believe that is how it works. I will say that - you should not expect constant playtime with them because these cats are toyed around with humans all day - do not be sad if they are sitting there sleeping because they cannot always be playing around. 4/5"

Here's just a few things that make it such a special place to me\n1. Kitty cats! All cats adoptable and vetted by the rescue they work with to ensure their cats are placed in a suitable environment that meets all their needs. Not every cat is a \"cafe cat\" but Mac Tabby's cats are some of the most social/outgoing cats you'll meet. The rescue and cafe does such a great job at making sure these cats are taken care of and going to the home they deserve.\n2. Friendly Staff. You will always see smiling faces when you walk in and everyone their seems to really enjoy their job. They are very kind and helpful towards customers and the kitties.\n3. Drinks! Definitely one of my favorite places for coffee. They have soooo many options to choose from and they can personalize almost anything you order! If you're allergic to cats, you still gotta come for the coffee, because their cafe area is cat free and just a very cozy environment to relax and watch kitties from the windows.\n4. Atmosphere and location. Mac Tabby Charlotte is located in the cool hippy like area of Noda. Very beautiful place to spend the day. The atmosphere of the cafe is very pleasant, spunky and comfortable.\n\nAll in all I give this place 100 stars! You need to visit this place! You will leave with the biggest smile on your face(:"

We had a WONDERFUL experience other than the lady who waited on us at our first visit - she was surprisingly a little nasty.  EVERYBODY else was totally GREAT!  We had been told not to bother with reservations which totally turned out to not be true.  MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!  ;-)  After getting a reservation then arriving later the same day, we went to the kitty lounge.  It's a 10 person limit in the lounge so our party of 8 (plus two others) was easily accomodated.\n\nWe did not get any food but the drinks we had were awesome. All 4 kids and 4 adults were super impressed with the drinks!\n\nOur one hour long segment with the cats in the lounge area was soooo sweet and yes - therapeutic!  The atmosphere was totally chill, from the staff to the kitties.  A couple of staff members were in the lounge and were very helpful with the kids engaging the kitties and answering all the questions from everybody.  The cats varied in type, age, color and disposition but without kittens (waaah) and yes, they are available for adoption.  The cat visit segment was just so great, I cannot put it into words.\n\nThe only (very small) problem that we had on the day we visited (6/30/2023) had nothing to do with Mac Tabby Cat Cafe nor the sort of nasty lady - there is a LOT of construction going on around the Mac Tabby location and hardly any parking available nearby.  HOWEVER, there is a nice free-parking(!!!) garage a very short 1/2 block away - so short that I didn't even work up a sweat on a 93 degree F day!\nBottom line:  Yes, we ALLL loved Mac Tabby!  Yes, we ALLL heartily recommend Mac Tabby!  And YES!  We will be back again on our next visit to North Carolina!"

I had heard of cat cafes before and while I would not consider myself a cat person (allergies) I always thought the concept was genius and would not hesitate to support it. As a result, we decided on an afternoon coffee after a hike and made the drive down to MacTabby. The cafe portion of the experience was great. The coffee flavors/options were unique and I had a hard time narrowing my selections down to something I would like because everything seemed awesome. This is separate and sectioned off so you can have your beverage in a different location and NOT socialize with the cats if you don't want to. The cat portion of the experience was so sweet. I took some allergy meds and just went for it...It was $8 for 30 minutes and the kitties were so social. Very friendly, very cute and very well cared for. Overall this was a wonderful experience that comes highly recommended if you're looking for a cat to adopt and/or just need some time with a little kitty that wants to be loved on."

The cat room is large enough that even though there were 10 people in there, it didn't seem crowded at all. We were free to move around and visit with several of the kittens; some were sleeping, some were active and playful. I was pretty excited that we could bring toys for them as well - as soon as we got there one of them practically jumped into my bag to get the catnip mice out :) Though we didn't get anything at the cafe', I like that there was a pretty big assortment and that you could bring your selection into the cat room with you (or they'd bring it in to you if you were already there). Knowing that a small fee goes to help so many of these wonderful cats, I'd be visiting there weekly if I lived in the area. I will absolutely make another stop in the next time I'm in the area."

I know this isn't strictly the cafes fault but I witness some children being super aggressive with the cats until they almost attacked. (Ex- shoving toys in their face, putting hands and fingers in their face when they're clearly annoyed, shoving toys in the employee only room where the litter boxes are, etc.) My only suggestion is allowing slots for people that are 18+ only, just to give older people time to unwind and interact/meet with the cats without kids present. Regardless awesome and friendly staff and great selection of drinks and cute kitties!"

After the owners response, I realize my judgement was wrong.  I'm all for the profits for the kitties.\n\nUpdate: I was able to finally go to for a reservation with the kitties! I was excited, but sad to find all of them were wiped from hours of play in the morning. Several kitties had URIs (Upper Respiratory Infection), which typically requires medicine and quarantine, so many of them were lethargic and sleepy and sick. I cleaned up some of their eye crusties, poor babies. I know it's just like the flu, so it's easily spreadable.\nI also disagree with the amount of people and time that were spent around the cats. The poor things need a break from so much interaction. Every 30 min to an hour, there about 8 people in the room at a time; maybe not always, but enough to exhaust these babies. I feel so bad for them."
