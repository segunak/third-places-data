What started as a way to serve his community, has branched into several other methods in which the Hartsell family helps to \u201cCelebrate Life.\u201d This coffee shop is dedicated to Jacob Hartsell and his hard work cultivating a family tradition of service to others.\n\nWe serve coffee, but we\u2019re not your typical coffee shop. Inspired by Jacob Hartsell, we\u2019ve created a space where ideas bloom and conversations flow. We\u2019ve made a conscious decision to enjoy every moment life has to offer. Come and stay awhile. Enjoy the aroma of life!",

They run specials with new flavors every month and are happy to customize whatever youd like. I highly recommend their cold brew! it has little to no acidity and a perfect balance of sweetness. They have non dairy options as well! There are some mini board games inside, seating outside, and a huge parking lot. Their restroom is very clean as well. Take the time to go here instead of Starbucks or Dunkin, you wont regret it!!"

My daughter researched their drinks and she said that it's in a funeral home.   I, of course, said what?  She told me again and I said that we definitely need to stop!  There was a hearse near the coffee shop door.   The place is small but unique.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.   We got the Lavender Hibiscus Lemonade and the Samoa Cookie Latte with Caramel Drizzle and Samoa Cookie Crumble (cold).  They were delicious and to die for!  Looking forward to coming back!"

I will say what sets them apart is its nice, quiet, but welcoming atmosphere to all who visit. I promise you, it won't be your last time coming. I can't wait to bring my daughter so she can try their Yoda Soda! She loves Baby Yoda! (They have star wars themed decor). Come visit your neighborhood Coffin House Coffee."

There's a small selection of board games while you hang out.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm a big fan of beard bakes baked goods (the strawberry buns are fluffy strawberry clouds sent DIRECTLY FROM THE HEAVENS ) and that's why I started going there.\n\nThe start of any coffee house is of course the coffee. The large Seattle chain tastes like it's burnt and thankfully that's not the case here. It's always smooth and flavorful. I did recently find a favorite (the vanilla latte)"

It is a small shop with 4 tables that has a unique theme and atmosphere which makes it stand out from other coffee shops. They have a variety of drinks that can be customized for different dietary needs. The staff was super friendly and helpful to any questions I had about the menu. They have WiFi you can use while staying there. They also have a variety of free games like chess, peg boards, and etc to play while staying here. I really enjoyed it. Bathroom was well kept up, had women products available for free, and super clean. A 10/10 for me. Will be returning to support this small business."

The people who work there are absolutely the kindest and funnest people. The Beard Bakes food is always delicious.\nI love the atmosphere of the shop. It's not a gothic style look. It's decorated very nicely and has photos and history of the funeral home. I hear a lot of \"complaints\" that this concept is very disrespectful and I personally don't think so. I've been a loyal customer since before they did their grand opening and the funeral home directors and employees as well as Coffin House employees are very kind, respectful, and caring people.\n\nI support ALOT of small businesses in the Concord area but this is by far one of my favorites!"
