But we prevailed. I'm surprised there's no Sabra Olive Tamponade Hummus(I think I spelled that correctly lol), but I may be thinking about Harris Teeter having that in stock.\nI gathered a few items and was interested in the Asian kitchen that they have set up, but was unfortunately closed and I didn't see their hours of operation, to make a future stop inside. Meanwhile, the cashiers were ending their shifts soon but I was able to gain the service of one. He was polite and serviced our order well.\nI enjoyed our visit, and may come back in the near future to check out their morning and early afternoon cafes."

Store is a joke, owned by Amazon but won't even match Amazon prices. Used to be \"the place to go\" for organics, but now everyone carries those. A Waste of retail space.\n\nPrices keep climbing, and they never have any turkey in the deli anymore? I've checked every week for almost 2 months and only once have they actually had turkey. Go to Harris Teeter instead, they offer a good selection of organics, local produce, their prices are much MUCH more reasonable and they've always had the cold cuts I need. Probably won't stop here anymore unless I need a very specific item I can't find anywhere else."

My first disappointment was when I went to get an organic no sugar matcha latte (which is hard to find elsewhere) i found the cafe closed. Apparently they close it at 2pm. Ive been to other whole foods where they are open much later. The manager said they can't staff it but Im not sure they try. Secondly visit to the restroom was also disappointing for the caliber of store and shopping area: dirty bathroom, toilet paper empty and hand soap empty. I told the manager but she didn't apologize but rather just said she would let \"them\" know. I also wish they would carry more bulk options of nuts and seeds and dried fruits. I've always had great experiences with staff and Amazon returns but this experience wasn't great. Side note: I wish WF would update their app to function better for the customer. Not sure who to talk to about this tho."

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a delightful atmosphere and a shopping experience like no other.\n\nLet's start with the food hot bar for dinner. The variety and quality of dishes available were truly impressive. The selection of freshly prepared meals catered to a wide range of dietary preferences, and each dish was bursting with flavor. Whether you're a meat lover, a vegetarian, or have specific dietary restrictions, the hot bar at Waverly Whole Foods has you covered. I found myself eagerly sampling different options, from deliciously seasoned proteins to vibrant and nutritious vegetable-based dishes. The attention to detail and commitment to providing wholesome, flavorful meals were evident in every bite.\n\nOne highlight of my visit was the comfortable outdoor turf space with tables and seating. It provided the perfect spot to enjoy my meal while savoring the beautiful weather. The well-maintained turf, coupled with ample seating options, created a relaxing and inviting environment. It was a welcome change to be able to dine outdoors in such a pleasant setting, surrounded by the vibrant energy of the store.\n\nSpeaking of the store, I was thoroughly impressed by its cleanliness. Waverly Whole Foods maintains a spotless environment, ensuring that customers can shop with confidence and peace of mind. From the well-organized aisles to the pristine displays, it was evident that cleanliness is a top priority for the store.

After having to move into this area recently from a different city and having to shop and eat at different Whole Foods stores out there, our expectations were set high and we couldn't wait to come into this Charlotte store and remember what used to be one of our favorite spots to enjoy their delicious hot food and pizza .... not so fast, what a disappointment! Their hot food items tasted BLAND and MEDIOCRE AT BEST and that's if I'm being nice about it! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DELICIOUSNESS OF THE FOOD IN THIS PLACE?! Oh how it has fallen! And for some reason I don't think it's just the Southern influence. Is it the lack of care and interest to make food deliciously enjoyable and fulfilling, or just the lack of interest to make food at all. Sadly this has been our experience in many eateries and food establishments in this part of the country lately. The food is not just matter we stuff our stomachs with in order to survive, it's there to bring enjoyment and beauty to people's lives. We barely ate half of what we bought (4 people), seemingly because we were that hungry and we threw half of what we bought at the hot foods out, because it was that disappointingly disgusting. I hope they improve in that department."

The gentleman in the meat department is always so helpful and remembers my favorite cuts when ever I stop by. All of the cashiers are always so kind and welcoming. Huge shout out to the management team! I thoroughly enjoy every visit at the Waverly location. South park on the other hand is a complete opposite experience.

Whole Foods Waverly is the best and it's all because of the employees.\n\nIt's the little things that I notice after spending hours and hours shopping here! One of my favorite employees is Aaron! He works diligently stocking the shelves and is always happy to walk with a customer if they're looking for something specific or unique. He has recommended so many new specialty products to me for a long time and my clients always appreciate when I incorporate new ingredients. He is a remarkable and dedicated team member. Jill is an associate that I see often as she shops for the online clients. If I ever have a question and she's close by she always seems to point me into he right direction. She's knowledge about so many products and I trust her recommendations!\n\nAssociates in every department throughout the store are always happy to be of service! I love talking with Cousin when I'm shopping for artisan cheeses. He's knowledgeable and I enjoy learning about the different stuff available and he is always so helpful.\n\nI truly wouldn't be able to do what I do if it weren't for the team in the butchers market. Dan is always available to tell me about new selections as they become available. He suggests something different every now and then and never lets me down! He's always leading the team and takes special care to make the case look spectacular and it shows...Every time I round the corner I see the vibrant colors of the kabobs...they pop and catch your eye...and the meats marinating always draw me in to see what new flavors they are using. If it weren't for one of the other associates, John I wouldn't get the most consistent Chateaubriand roasts. He trims them precisely and ties them up perfectly so my job is practically done and they always come out perfect! A gentleman nicknamed \"Fish\"  always has a great suggestion for the best method to cook specific cuts of meat. I've been cooking for 25 years and I'm still learning and it's guys like Fish that keep inspiring me. Mark and Matt just recently recommended the Bavette Sirloin steaks for some fajitas a client wanted me to make...I usually use Skirt steak and Mark was shocked that I wasn't familiar with this cut from the sirloin. I'm impressed with the difference and look forward to coming up with different recipes where I can use it.\n\nI know I can always count on Whole Foods Waverly for the freshest seafood when I need it. Imad in the seafood shop is a master at his craft! His attention to detail is impressive and I really appreciate the extra touches he adds to the display case. He works proficiently and is extremely knowledgeable. I also enjoy talking with Jake about where the fish is sourced and his opinion regarding different selections. It because of them that I've tried to encourage my clients to eat something different from their usual.\n\nRich and Lizzy are just 2 of the team members that are always available to assist in the produce department. Rich takes pride in his displays and no matter how busy the store seems he and the team are always working swiftly to keep the freshest fruit and veggies available. Over the years I've seen so many new products available and they always seem to know quite a bit about where it's sourced & how it's grown.\n\nAs I head to check out I can always trust the front end team. Debbie Z, Sonia & Keri are just a few of the great employees that are always so pleasant and helpful with anything related to customer service.\n\nI don't know who reads these things but I wanted to throw it out there...the entire team at Waverly should be recognized."
