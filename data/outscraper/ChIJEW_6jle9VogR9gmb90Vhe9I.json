I came in to do some paperwork on my computer sat down and before I knew it I had this lovely presentation for my coffee which was outstanding, I was extremely pleasantly surprised when I took my first sip. It was very pretty but I was not expecting the flavor to be so spot on. I honestly can't remember the last time  I have  had coffee this good and I love coffee. The girl who made it was incredibly polite and kind. The service was excellent. It was a quiet atmosphere. I will definitely be back. I have a huge comfortable couch where you can sit at a table, but it's a big open space and it doesn't feel cramped or overcrowded. This is my second time there. I also did have the coffee cake milk cake which was again out of this world. I asked that they had tiramisu and she recommended the coffee cake because they did not and I was not disappointed at all. I found a new dessert that I absolutely love. I did notice that the girl who works there skipped over the part where I'm allowed to tip her on the computer system I had to ask her for her copy of the receipt so I could write down her tip on there & it. She was just going to give me my receipt and nowhere to tip.  and she did the same thing when my mom went to pay her as well because my mom came and met me and I didn't know what coffee she wanted two separate transactions. So if you go and you get this wonderful young lady I recommend tipping her and maybe doing it in cash to make sure that she is able to get her to because I don't think she gets paid enough.  I know when Mount Holly finds out about this gem it'll get crowded and not be a quiet place to work anymore but I'll still go back for the coffee! I cannot express enough that I can't remember the last time that I have had coffee that tasted this good!"

If i were the owner i would incorporate a \"few\" very simple small sandwiches (no more than 3/4 diff types) like grilled cheese, chicken salad croissants, egg salad & basic ham/turkey-lettuce & tomato-edges cut off, mini banana nut muffins, thats it to add to the different coffees. They can shorten the other items on t menu to one type of cake & cheesecake slices and/or sweet potato pie. Simple.. To keep the focus on coffees"

            "review_text": "This place can broaden your horizons when it comes to coffee- or you can get the same old thing, if you prefer.\n\nThey have many different styles of coffee that you may not have experienced!\n\nThis break opened shop is a one of a kind gem- guaranteed to give you a unique and pleasant experience!\n\nI got a Mufuaar- which was very good! I loved the cardamom.\nI can't wait to go back and try some other drinks!\n\nThey're still building out the location, but there is a lot of seating and the service was great- very friendly and willing to provide recommendations.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the styles of drink- I recommend ordering a large, as some of the styles of drink have the spices or coffee grounds in it- making the bottom of the drink grainy.\nAlso they often come out very hot - careful!\n\nI highly recommend you give this new, unique coffee shop a try. I know I will certainly be back!"

All 4 beverages were delicious!  Highly recommend.  They should have pastries soon, and will be doing more decorating."
