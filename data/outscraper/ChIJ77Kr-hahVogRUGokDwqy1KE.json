I've been meaning to stop by for a while, but there's always a conflict with my work schedule. I finally made it yesterday, Saturday  12-23-23.\n\nThe vibe was serene the moment I stepped inside. I'm not sure what I smelled as I was getting ready to order, but I thought for sure I smelled a hint of ginger. The young lady who took my order was pleasant and eager to answer my questions being a first timer. The menu is extensive, especially if you love tea. I liked that there was also a description of both the tea ingredients and how it benefits you. The other lady (assumed it was the owner) was just as pleasant.\n\nI ordered lemon ginger tea and macaroons. Both were delicious as I sipped and took bites while writing in my journal. I was on my way to visit nursing home residents and spread some holiday cheer. This was a perfect way to get in a little self care.\n\nI couldn't stay as long as I wanted to. If it were up to me, I'd have stayed until they closed at 4 pm. They'll be closed from December 24 - January 1, so I know it was God's will for me to go & have this experience to end 2023. As if I couldn't be wooed any more, I stumbled across the prayer room as I was leaving. I can't wait to return in 2024! I anticipate it being one of my tranquility Saturday spots in the new year."
