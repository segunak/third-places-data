Trust me when I tell you buying that gorgeous paper to wrap that special gift is worth it! I've done it many times and people have not forgotten how I presented their gifts. A few of my friends and family have actually saved the paper.\n\nThis store is nicely laid out!\nAlthough my son is grown, I checked out the children's area. It's a delight!\nAnd the cafe is large and well-lit.\n\nBooklovers, families, you will spend at least an hour here. Meet for play dates, besties, this will be your new hangout!\n\nCheck out my pics/videos and follow me here on Google Maps as I explore and contribute.\n\nI have a huge trip to Washington DC, coming up in mid to late May, 2024.\n\nEnjoy!\nJosephine"

Especially the art magazines. Almost none. I think today is the first time I've left a B&N without purchasing anything. I guess I'll have to continue to drive to Birkdale for my monthly B&N fix.\n\nIf you're not interested in magazines, this is an excellent B&N."

A fantastic addition to the area and especially this shopping center.\n\nFor the grand opening, everyone was super helpful and looking to make sure everyone was able to find the books they were interested in. As you'd hope. However cashier Meghann was a highlight as she was very accommodating towards my elderly grandparents while totaling their mountain of cooking & coloring books.\n\nGlad to have a new bookstore in the area to check whenever the new releases I have my eye on arrive on store shelves."
