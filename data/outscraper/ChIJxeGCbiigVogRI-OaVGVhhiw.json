Come in ready for that type of experience!\n\nThey work with Crown Town compost, who picks up their waste weekly. Sara tells me that coffee shops can compost virtually everything, which was great to learn. They are eco friendly and offer a host of alternative milks. Their beans are locally roasted and the pastries are baked in Charlotte as well.\n\nThey have two locations in Charlotte and I'm sorry to only be able to visit one. Next visit it will be on my list."
