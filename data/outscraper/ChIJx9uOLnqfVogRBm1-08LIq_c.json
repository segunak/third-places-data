I've had the ube taro drink multiple times now, and they use REAL ingredients for so much if not all of their drinks! The ube taro drink had ube halaya, for example, and you can see them slicing fruits in the back often. My lychee jade tea drink also had cut up lychee also floating around!\n\nMy friends who are also Asian transplants from big cities all agree this place is super good. For me, it's among the best boba drinks I've ever had, even on the west coast! I will be going out of my way for this place often"

The decor is very nice and there are plenty of seating options.\nThey have a wide variety of drinks and sweets like macarons and rolled ice cream. Seriously, the menu has something for every sweet tooth. Now, I'm a sucker for anything, Ube, so I order the Ube meets Taro Milk Cap Drink. I added lychee jelly as my topping. The milk cap caught me off guard as it was a bite salty. The owner did say they had to make it fresh as they ran out right before we got there. Otherwise, everything was great. The owner even offered my son some gummy bears to hold him over.\nI would recommend minus the milk cap at least for me next time."

The space was cute and clean.\n\nThe menu has a large variety of milk and tea-based flavors and also some desserts! I'm not a tea or milk drinker and typically go for slushes or smoothies, but ended going with the mango lemonade and strawberry lemonade (which include non caffeinated tea). I appreciated that I could confirm I wanted to include boba as well as the standard amount of sweetness and took them both home in a convenient bag.\n\nNot only were the drinks pretty to look at but they were also delicious! Super fresh and luckily for me, I couldn't taste the tea at all lol. I wonder if it'd be easy enough to create smoothie versions of the same drinks by substituting tea with ice. Excited to come back and try some of the desserts next time!"

We highly recommend SipCha! We can't wait to visit again to try more!\n\nThey are located right behind Tous Les Jours in the same building.

It's all connected. SipCha does have its own entrance located in the back with more parking spaces rather than the front of the building right off South Blvd.  I was greeted immediately and warmly by the cashier (failed to get her name) and was given great recommendations and explained everything in detail. I tried out their seasonal Watermelon Slush, which came with Milk Cap.  The juice itself was SUPER REFRESHING on a hot summer day as today. It was not so sweet. Now, unfortunately, I did not like the Milk Cap foam AT ALL! it literally tasted like sea water to me. It was so salty. Thankfully, the foam did not mix into my drink, so I was able to drink the juice and avoid the foam. Other than that, it was delicious! I will definitely be returning to try other drinks and some of their pastries."

It is attached to the Tous Le Jour and it is really nice, the decor that was present throughout was great, I love the fact that it was intimate but at the same time there were plenty of seats for people.\nService was good, I was like a deer in headlights looking at the menu, and they were very patient with me. I had a million questions about the different drinks and toppings and what goes with what, lol.  I'm sure I got on their nerves, but they took good care of me.\nI had the Dragon in a Bottle, Green Pomegranate to drink, and to eat I chose the Mango Cloud.  The highlight of the trip was definitely the mango cloud. It was full of flavor, but it was sooooooo tiny! I enjoyed both drinks; I added tapioca and blueberry popping to my Dragon in a bottle. It was such a chill environment, I would definitely go there to get a drink and do some work or meet up with friends!"
