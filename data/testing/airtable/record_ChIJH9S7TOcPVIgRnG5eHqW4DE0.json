        "Comments": "Has a rustic cabin aesthetic, down to the scent, coffee mixed with a woodsy aroma that feels warm and authentic. Wooden chairs, cowhide rugs, plenty of art on the walls, Bohemian vibes, and reading lamps scattered across tables. Someone put real care into this space, and it shows. More than anything, though, I have to praise the cinnamon rolls they get from Honeybear Bake Shop in Charlotte. They have cream cheese frosting with a hint of maple flavor that seeps perfectly into the roll. As a self-proclaimed cinnamon roll connoisseur, it's fantastic. The sheer size combined with the standout frosting puts it on another level. Cream cheese frosting is famously difficult to get right on cinnamon rolls, so the quality of this one is all the more impressive. Until the day I had this cinnamon roll, I was convinced Sunflour Bakery had the best in greater Charlotte. Now Iâ€™m in doubt. Honeybear Bake Shop is serious business, and Mattie Ruthâ€™s is blessed for carrying their rolls. This is a cool area in general. Gibson Mill Market is right across the street, which is similar to Optimist Hall but with a more relaxed \"friends and family\" vibe rather than the increasingly crowded, pretentious, \"we have a huge lot, but you have to pay for parking now,\" trendy TikTok influencer vibe that Optimist has drifted toward ðŸ˜ž.\n",
