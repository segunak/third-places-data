The parking lot fills up pretty quickly but if you don't mind walking there's always spaces at the back. All in all one of my favorite places to pop into just to take a break and get a cup of coffees. FYI...It's not a \"normal\" Starbucks as in...they don't use the app and you don't earn points. I'm not sure if you can upload a receipt or not to earn points...I've never tried."

Especially their Christmas stuff.\n\nI've also purchased some unique toys as gifts for my son & people who have just had babies and for birthdays.\n\nI usually do a more extensive number of photos and videos, but this is all I happened to do a few days ago. It was a chance to visit to Charlotte and I made my way here.\n\nThere is such peace in reading a book, and I hope that Barnes & Noble continues to thrive in the age of digital.\n\nEnjoy!\nXO\nJosephine"

We got a little lost looking for it, and of course in true book shopping fashion, ended up filling our arms with more find than we were aiming for. We even found ATEEZ' most recent EP (ATEEZ THE WORLD EP.1 :MOVEMENT)! I was pretty excited, after purchasing all our finds; we spent the afternoon unboxing our albums and reading though a few books; before checking out their vinyl collection then heading out. It was a great trip to the boom store, the are is lovely and honestly, I couldn't imagine a better time!"

Excellent selection of books from all genres. Decent selection of board games too. The only part of the store that felt a teensy bit like it didn't fit was the large movie area. It just felt like a huge space that was not very full. The cashier was super friendly and kind. All in all, great experience. Oh and parking was easy!"

Her attitude belonged at a fast food restaurant where that kind of service is expected! My entire interaction with this associate was beyond horrible and I expect in today's time you need to be able to keep your customers! With the way I was treated by this associate I will not return to that store! The store manager Michael attempted to handle the situation and provided me with your district manager contact info. I highly suggest putting your employee through a customer service class so she learns how to interact in a civilized manner!!"
