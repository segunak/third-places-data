It's only for customers. I told her I use the drive-through. She was really nasty and disrespectful. I asked for her name. She told me she's the manager Rhonda. She was African-American lady.

They said \"if we have to use a side cup, then we have to charge you\" and I was like \"OK\". Other locations never charged me but it was not worth an argument. So my coffee cost about $9/ day (which is kinda ridiculous!). So that's about $3k/yr!\n\nOne day I order my usual drink and the lady requests that the manager ALIVIA speak with me and she said \"we can't serve foam on the side anymore for you. I can still serve your coffee though\" and I wondered if this were a corporate policy or a fake fabricated policy created to be Petty for no reason ( I was always a kind and pleasant customer), so I emailed Starbucks corporate and as suspected this  \"policy\" was a shady lie. My best guess is that they thought I should be paying more than $9 for coffee everyday and didn't have a button to charge me more. Either way, they lie and make up fake rules because they don't care about your experience, they care about sucking every single penny out of you possible. There are other examples I could give of my experience at this store, but too long to post!"

When visiting in-store, there is a lot of rushing around, which is likely the cause of orders being incorrect. I understand being on a timer, but accuracy should be more important than how fast the order is completed. I am not sure if all staff members know their drink size limitations, as I was previously informed that the Matcha Lemonade does not come in Trenta size, which is false. Customer service leaves much to be desired. My interactions with baristas have been a mixed bag. Baristas either seem confused or curt. I do love that they are conveniently close, but I'd rather drive further for better service."

My issue with this location was an incident I was involved in this morning 12/23/23 7:35am. Long story short I decided last minute to place an online order on my way to work for a tall latte (NOT TOO HARD OF AN ORDER. LOCATION WAS NOT BUSY). I will admit I ordered it about 1 minutes before pulling in due to like I said it being a last minute decision. Once I got there I went in the drive through and told them I have a mobile order etc and they told me to pull forward. The employee at the window said \"It will just be a few minutes they are finishing making your drink.\" A different employee came up to the window who I was assuming was a \"Shift Lead\" of some sort and she told me \"We have told you MULTIPLE times to please order 15 min ahead of time for your mobile orders and do not place it when you are here on our app. If you could ACTUALLY follow these instructions that would be great. Do not do it again\" I was in absolute shock and said \"okay\". As I was waiting for my latte to be finished being made it finally hit me that she said \"they have told me multiple times\". I have never been told this by ANY location before. Nor have I \"always\" done that. Therefore I told the drive through worker that \"his lead who spoke to me needs to be more kind and that I have NEVER EVER been told this before. The lead might have me confused with someone else. Approaching a customer like that was highly inappropriate and to always make sure she has her facts correct before making the assumption and pissing a customer right off.\" I am very angry and disappointed in the service I received today. If I was not heading to work I would have gone in the store and made a complaint to her face and speak or request to speak to whoever is above her. Customers who do not deserve these remarks do not need to have someone scolding them at 7:30am for NO reason. Recognize you clients/customers correctly before anything. Matter of fact TREAT ALL CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT!"

I brought up to one of the employees that maybe they could put up a sign that just says \"Do not block exit\" to the cars joining the line, which seems like a pretty feasible and effective solution? The employee just said \"yeah I don't know, if people are impatient there's nothing I can really do about it.\" When I tried to suggest putting up a sign and said I'm not blaming them, he just asked if I wanted a receipt and then said \"have a nice day\" totally dismissing me lol. Kinda makes it seem like they don't care about customer feedback on what seems like a very easily solved problem. Weird!"

Team is always so nice and works very hard -- the drive-thru line is always SO long, it's like they cannot take a breathe some mornings. That said, the inside of the store looks over utilized by customers, who don't seem to remember to pick-up after themselves. The furniture looks a bit over-loved and customers often leave messes behind when they leave the store. The outdoor seating is nice, though it is attached to the parking lot so if there is a car line you almost feel like you're a part of it. Great for mobile orders, too."

I can tell the difference immediately upon the first sip. I am a contractor and drive all over the Charlotte/Pineville/Waxhaw areas. This is the ONLY location where I do not get my money's worth. Staff is nice, but I'm spending money on a drink. It seems like all the low scored reviews are easy fixes, but will it improve?...I doubt it. Haven't been to this location in over 6 months, but it's a disappointment each time. Now that prices have increased and rewards received are lower, there is even less to look forward to at this location. More money and less stars is a corporate issue. But consistent, poorly made drinks are no good for such a well-known corporation/brand."

Nonetheless I would not put her in a customer facing position because it was very off putting and makes me less likely to return to this store. I was trying to decide what I wanted and after asking twice if there was \"anything else\" the third time she SCREAMED \"ANYTHING ELSE\"? aThen with my I was already upset with her attitude but when I asked for a straw and drove off because I had had enough she hung out the window and SCREAMED \"THANK YOU\" wow just wow lady time for you to move in this is very ooor customer service.

I spoke with the manager and explained what was wrong with my drink and the only explanation she could provide was oh we're trying to come back from Covid not how may I fix the issue. I ordered the strawberry Acai with extra sugar. They left out the dry strawberries but when I went it other drinks were being prepared with them for me to be told oh I just opened those. Excuse me ma'am did you not think to open them early on when you see you were running out. The drink is was very watery with lemonade added. Skip this location if you can that's all I will say."

From what I saw the folks that work there do a fantastic job in a very high stress/volume situation.

Our drinks were perfect and we went upstairs to get away from the draft that blew when the doors opened.\n\nThere was an older masked man sitting at the corner table hidden behind a backpack and open laptop on his table that stared at me menacingly as I took a table by the window out of his view.\nMy daughter came up behind me and said that he stared at her with both middle fingers straight up. I thought nothing of it and we started chatting.\nAt one point he walked into my view to peer over the railing down stairs. He kept shaking his hand at me as if to shoo us away. That caught my attention!\nWhen we finished and were preparing to leave, he glared at us and again raised his middle finger. I asked him from across the room what he was doing and he said with a sneer \"F@&K YOU\"! With my family there I did not want to engage any further so we quickly went downstairs to speak to the staff.\nThey described him and unapologetically said they knew exactly who he was. The whole time he glared down at us from upstairs. We got the feeling that at this Starbucks store it was accepted that an abusive obscene masked man owns the upstairs lounge and it was not a family oriented store so we left.\nAs we walked to our cars he continued his one finger salute from the upstairs window near the table we were just sitting at.\nBoth my wife and daughter -who are avid Starbucks customers- said they were glad I was there or they would have not felt safe and further said they would not return either."

The woman at the window was so kind, told me she was so sorry and asked how she could help, and gave me a couple of gift cards.  I know that seems like not a big deal but to me on that day it meant everything.  I actually went in there in person for first time today and every single employee greeted me and asked how I was.  I'm with my children full time so I don't go too many places alone these days but this will forever be my go to spot when I need some peace (and some great service).  Thank you!"

There was one girl working making coffee and managing the drive through window. Finally one of the talkers noticed me and asked \"can I help you with something?\" I responded I had a mobile order. She said it's coming, and I watched her pull several labels off the printer and put them on cups, one of these was my beverage (I noticed the Splenda packets) and she finished making my drink made a couple of others and then brought me mine. On my way back to my car I noticed the drive through line was longer and the car that pulled in behind me had not made it to the menu/order board. Long story, if you want to wait a long time for a mediocre cup of coffee then by all means go to this location, if you want good service and a good cup of coffee go to the Starbucks at Park Towne Village!"

I'm sick of paying 3.50 for an iced coffee that isn't even correct. Let alone basically having my card and drink thrown at me. Will not be returning!!!"
