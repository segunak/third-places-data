I went up to the barista to ask for the code, they said it's for paying customers and that I have to order or else I can't use. I told her I already ordered, then she didn't even know the code and gave me a wrong code. Which I had to go back and forth until one of them finally knew the right code. After I used the restroom, my order wasn't even ready and I waited another 5 mins. Meanwhile, new customers coming in but they won't acknowledge a person until someone actually went up to them and asked if they could be helped. I have never been to a Starbucks that a customer had to actually ask for help to get service. This will be first."

I won't name names because I don't want them to get in trouble, however, the barista gave me a very ugly look and told me they would ask their manager. I'm not entirely sure why they had to do that, but I digress. The manager on duty, her name was Morgan, stopped what she was doing, came over and listened to me explain what had happened, and had zero problems remaking my drink for me. They seemed quite busy, but she prioritized my drink, wrote my name, and even drew a little smiley face on my cup! That small gesture made my entire day. She also made a very good flat white. She was great! Be like her!"

However, my experience today was deeply disappointing.\n\nI waited in the drive-thru for over 25 minutes without my order being taken--10 of those minutes were spent at the speaker box. After waiting patiently, I eventually said \"hello?\" only to be met with a curt response: \"Yeah, um, we're busy!\" I continued to wait, but there were no visible cars ahead of me for quite some time. Meanwhile, I could see three cars behind me, clearly frustrated, stuck in a line we couldn't leave.\n\nWhen I decided to leave after waiting too long, I turned the corner and saw a car being served at the window. To my surprise, it appeared that several cars had been served while no new orders were being taken. I pulled up and politely asked to place my order, explaining that I had been in line for over 20 minutes. The staff member at the window, however, told me, \"Unfortunately no, you'll need to go around.\"\n\nI expressed how unfair this felt, but my concerns were dismissed. When I asked to speak to a manager, Morgan arrived with the same indifferent attitude. I asked for the staff members' names and left.\n\nThis experience left me questioning why I was treated so poorly. I visit this location several times a week and work within a mile of it. Normally, my visits are pleasant, but today's experience has made me reconsider returning.\n\nI understand that situations arise where staff may be overwhelmed or understaffed, but the lack of communication, empathy, and customer service today was unacceptable."

Jordyn didn't even apologize for my experience! As a manager, she handled the situation very horribly especially because she knows I am always in here! I will not come back to this Starbucks and I am going to sell my Starbucks stock, prices have gone up, value and service have gone down, and consider taking my business elsewhere!"
