Drip coffee was good, latte was so so but I'd chock that up to training and not necessarily espresso, milk, or syrups. Whole place could use a good deep cleaning. Dust caked on air registers and the front white counter could use a magic erasing. Also noticed several customers that tried to buy beans but they only had decaf stocked. Missed sales opportunities."

I googled coffee shops near me and was instantly attracted to the name \"Verb Coffee\" as my plan was a little caffeine and sustenance to get my body activated for the long day ahead. When you follow the gps to this location drive slow and careful as one wrong turn may set your arrival time back a few minutes and can lead to frustration. Anyway the parking lot has plenty of space. The atmosphere is very open, light, and calming. I came on a Friday afternoon and met Cameron. He was very welcoming and knowledgeable and just overall very nice and inviting person. I told him what my mood was  and he made his suggestions. I ended up drinking their cold brew and having a light avocado toast. Cameron explained most their products they use other local businesses to supply and I absolutely loved that. There is WiFi and plenty of space for students to hang out and get some work done. The pictures speak  for themselves.\n-Lydia Hamilton 11/9/2024 1:32pm\nInstagram: @shotsoflydi"

Yet, there is plenty of parking once ypu get there.\n\nThe actually shop is not big as you have about six little seating areas including two couches. They do offer three more seating areas outside.\n\nWhile I'm not a big coffee person, I do love apple cider and they had an apple cider Chai on the menu. It was very good. I also order the eggs and hash. It was a bit on the small size yet good. Make sure to tell them how you want your eggs as they come over easy. It's a good local shop if you are in the area."
