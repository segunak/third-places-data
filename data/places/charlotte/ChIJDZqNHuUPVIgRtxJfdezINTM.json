I was going to opt for a matcha when he informed me they couldn't do half-caf lattes, but his overall demeanor and the way he handle me genuinely hurt my feelings. I drove over 40 mins to check this place out, but left a bit heartbroken and without ordering anything."

The coffee was pretty good, the flavor of the espresso was more on the fruity side but wasn't super strong so the milk in my capp was a bit overpowering.

Coffee is always great & the latte art never disappoints. The first time i walked in & got a coffee from Preston he made me feel like i was a good friend from years back, you don't find that from most coffee shops these days. This location seems like it's about to knock my socks off. With all that being said i am going tomorrow & will most likely stand firm on my 5 star review."
