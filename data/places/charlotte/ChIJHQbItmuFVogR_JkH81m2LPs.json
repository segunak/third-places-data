I regularly visit this library, and there are always many employees, but some of them are not very available or friendly when dealing with people.\n\nOn one occasion, an employee approached the table where I was working with my son and, in an authoritative and unpleasant manner, told me that I had to leave the table and that only my son could stay because he is a teenager. I tried to explain that we were working together and that\u2019s why we were using the table, but she cut me off and left me mid-sentence.\n\nOn another occasion, I needed to print a document. They told me the printer was closed, even though it wasn't yet closing time. Apparently, there is an internal rule that only they know about, where they shut down all the technology equipment 15 minutes before closing.\n\nAnother day, I sent a document to the printer, and the lady refused to help me because she was busy.\n\nAlmost everyone seems to be in a surprising rush to get rid of you, rather than to help.\n\nI love libraries, especially using the one in my community, but this situation is leaving me disillusioned.",

There are not less than five signs in the area indicating this, including one prominently displayed on each table.  Working with a teen is not the same as being a teen.  You were definitely not singled out; we frequently have to ask adults to leave the teen area, many of whom are working with a teen.\nRegarding the public computers being unavailable beginning 15 minutes prior to closing each day, that is the case at all YCL libraries and many other public libraries as well.  The reservation software has been set the way for many years by the library\u2019s IT department so that the building can be ready to be vacated at closing time.  There is also a sign indicating this at the library\u2019s entrance.  Regarding the employee who \u201crefused\u201d to help you print a document because she was busy, please ask to speak to the manager if something like that happens.  I am confident that there was just a misunderstanding; it is likely that the employee was in the middle of helping another patron and needed you to wait.  Our staff are incredibly helpful and friendly (yet also busy), which is the overwhelming consensus among our patrons.  We hope that you will keep an open mind and continue to use your local library.\n",

The Storytime teacher, Ms. Bethany is an absolute gem, but our interactions with everyone else has honestly been anywhere from uncomfortable to down right rude. Today two members of the front desk staff came over to tell me to quiet my kiddo and his little buddy down because they were 'singing the ABC's too loudly'. They were sitting at the kids table in the kids area reading ABC books when they decided to sing - what a wonderful, normal toddler thing to do. Meanwhile Toddler Storytime is going on - it's a kiddo hour at the library. So so sad that our local library is so, so unfriendly.",

Regardless, we actually have eight toys available in our children\u2019s area; you must have missed the others.  In addition, we offer many programs/events for young children every month other than August (our planning month).  Last month, for instance, we offered a total of 40 program sessions for children under age five (not to mention the programs for older children); a total of 1,522 patrons attended those 40 programs.  A number of those programs have additional toys available for young children.  Due to the large crowds that often visit our library, we do not have the space available to leave more toys out in the children\u2019s area.  If we had a larger building (which, as the head librarian noted, we do not have the money for), we would certainly expand our children\u2019s area and include more toys.  We hope that you will return and give us a chance to prove that we are in no way a 1-star library.  I can assure you that the service you and your children would receive from our talented and passionate staff would be unsurpassed by other libraries that you have visited.  ",

Thankfully we are part of the SCLENDS consortium, so there a wide variety of titles that patrons can choose from and place on hold for pick up at the Fort Mill Public Library, often within a few days. It is true that there is often a significant wait time for new bestsellers due to the financial impossibility of purchasing enough copies to satisfy public demand; this is a common challenge for public libraries. If you have not spoken to the branch manager about the book that you are sure you returned but are being required to pay for, please do so.

Patrons and staff laugh loudly.  Behind the circulation desk cabinets, and drawers are being slammed. There is no whispering or shushing, to create a quiet environment. It is really hard to study or do homework because of all the distractions. I wish there was a place to go for quiet studying. I do appreciate the access to books.

Real students study early mornings or late nights, I have no idea why they don\u2019t extend hours for these times. This library is not college student friendly, it might as well be a Barnes and Noble without the coffee place. It needs some serious upgrades for it to be a good library. And it\u2019s a shame because this is walking distance from my house.",

I mean how do you expect the youth to get good grades if you don't provide us with adequate facilities to do the ridiculous amount of coursework we're supposed to accomplish? Typical old people not having a good perspective.\n\nAnd it's not even open during the hours that students study.

I tried to explain that we were working together and that\u2019s why we were using the table, but she cut me off and left me mid-sentence.\n\nOn another occasion, I needed to print a document. They told me the printer was closed, even though it wasn't yet closing time. Apparently, there is an internal rule that only they know about, where they shut down all the technology equipment 15 minutes before closing.\n\nAnother day, I sent a document to the printer, and the lady refused to help me because she was busy.\n\nAlmost everyone seems to be in a surprising rush to get rid of you, rather than to help.\n\nI love libraries, especially using the one in my community, but this situation is leaving me disillusioned.",

There are not less than five signs in the area indicating this, including one prominently displayed on each table.  Working with a teen is not the same as being a teen.  You were definitely not singled out; we frequently have to ask adults to leave the teen area, many of whom are working with a teen.\nRegarding the public computers being unavailable beginning 15 minutes prior to closing each day, that is the case at all YCL libraries and many other public libraries as well.  The reservation software has been set the way for many years by the library\u2019s IT department so that the building can be ready to be vacated at closing time.  There is also a sign indicating this at the library\u2019s entrance.  Regarding the employee who \u201crefused\u201d to help you print a document because she was busy, please ask to speak to the manager if something like that happens.  I am confident that there was just a misunderstanding; it is likely that the employee was in the middle of helping another patron and needed you to wait.  Our staff are incredibly helpful and friendly (yet also busy), which is the overwhelming consensus among our patrons.  We hope that you will keep an open mind and continue to use your local library.\n",

The Storytime teacher, Ms. Bethany is an absolute gem, but our interactions with everyone else has honestly been anywhere from uncomfortable to down right rude. Today two members of the front desk staff came over to tell me to quiet my kiddo and his little buddy down because they were 'singing the ABC's too loudly'. They were sitting at the kids table in the kids area reading ABC books when they decided to sing - what a wonderful, normal toddler thing to do. Meanwhile Toddler Storytime is going on - it's a kiddo hour at the library. So so sad that our local library is so, so unfriendly.",

Regardless, we actually have eight toys available in our children\u2019s area; you must have missed the others.  In addition, we offer many programs/events for young children every month other than August (our planning month).  Last month, for instance, we offered a total of 40 program sessions for children under age five (not to mention the programs for older children); a total of 1,522 patrons attended those 40 programs.  A number of those programs have additional toys available for young children.  Due to the large crowds that often visit our library, we do not have the space available to leave more toys out in the children\u2019s area.  If we had a larger building (which, as the head librarian noted, we do not have the money for), we would certainly expand our children\u2019s area and include more toys.  We hope that you will return and give us a chance to prove that we are in no way a 1-star library.  I can assure you that the service you and your children would receive from our talented and passionate staff would be unsurpassed by other libraries that you have visited.  ",

It is true that there is often a significant wait time for new bestsellers due to the financial impossibility of purchasing enough copies to satisfy public demand; this is a common challenge for public libraries. If you have not spoken to the branch manager about the book that you are sure you returned but are being required to pay for, please do so. We do have a procedure in place for those types of situations.  We hope to see you again soon.",

As a college student I wanted to go there to study over break, but the staff is very distracting as well as the little kids coming in to play.\nThere\u2019s no isolated place for individual study, and only a couple of tables in which you can be easily distracted by people walking in or the staff chatting with each other.\nAlso the library is open at some pretty inconvenient hours, only during office hours. Real students study early mornings or late nights, I have no idea why they don\u2019t extend hours for these times. This library is not college student friendly, it might as well be a Barnes and Noble without the coffee place. It needs some serious upgrades for it to be a good library. And it\u2019s a shame because this is walking distance from my house.",
