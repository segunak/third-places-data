Maybe its better if theres a bunch of sugar and milk and such but it still doesn't change the quality of their beans.  Nice large space a touch noisy, as its a chain i dont know if other locations are like this but Ill just stick with haraz in spite of its location being smaller their coffee products are far superior in my opinion.  I had the coconut dessert and the med carafe of the saffron cardomom medium roast."

Qahwah House nailed it! Their coffees are rich, full-bodied & just downright flavorful.\nAll 3 of us: my husband, my son and myself were also really impressed with the sweets which are a perfect companion to the coffee. You've also got to read the walls which tell the story of their coffee & founders.\n\nI recommend bringing a book, a laptop and some friends.\nStay awhile...\n\nJosephine Local Guide "

It was very clean and they seemed to be fully staffed which is rare. The staff were very friendly. They also seem to take allergies seriously as they had a sign saying to ask the server about ingredients in their food and drinks.

It was so moist & thick & coconut-y. Absolutely perfect. We were also offered samples of one of their Yemeni coffees & Chai, which were both THE most amazing coffee & tea I have ever had in the central piedmont region. I will absolutely be making the commute back to Charlotte on the regular to come here. I had been looking forward to coming here since before they had opened & they surely didn't disappoint. Alhamdulillah for Qahwah House  With an amazing products & unmatched customer service I'm sure this business will absolutely thrive in the Charlotte area.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee hits you first--inviting, rich, and full of promise. Then there's the staff: they're not just employees, they're coffee enthusiasts. Each recommendation felt personal, as if they had crafted the menu just for me.\n\nShout out to Mariam and Zac!!\n\nI ordered the ginger tea with honey but was recommended Jubani Coffee and honestly, it's more than a drink--it's an experience in a cup. The flavors were perfectly balanced, with just the right sweetness to make you smile. The ambiance was equally thoughtful: music, natural lighting, and little design touches that made it feel like a second home.\nWhat really sets this place apart, though, is the care. Every detail, from the way the barista explained my drink to the warm \"goodbye\" as I left, makes you feel seen and valued. If you're looking for more than just coffee--if you're looking for connection and quality--this is the spot."

It's perfectly sweet, flaky, and pairs so well with their one-of-a-kind Adani Chai. Speaking of the chai, it's an absolute must-try--rich, aromatic, and unlike anything else you'll find in the city.\n\nIf you're a coffee or tea lover, Qahwah House is a spot you'll keep coming back to.

I truly don't think I have ever tasted anything quite as good as that pistachio latte. We both couldn't get over that one! The brown sugar latte was also fantastic - I tasted lots of warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg - and the honeycomb came out warm and drizzled with honey... holy moly. Unbelievable. The bread reminded me of a yeast roll, and several pockets of it had a cream cheese mixture that's tartness was perfectly balanced with the sweet honey.\n\nWe already can't wait to come back. Such an incredible new addition to Plaza Midwood!"

            "review_text": "I recently started looking for places that stay open late with a warm, inviting environment and offer great food and service, and this coffee house is that and more! The customer service is very warm and friendly. The overall design and layout of the shop is spacious and absolutely beautiful. This is a great place to enjoy yourself and make great memories.\n\nI can be a bit anxious socially, and I was initially worried when I first entered the shop due to its high volume of customers at the time. I sat at the coffee bar with a close friend, and despite our initial worries, we spent about three hours there! You can tell that this space is focused on creating and housing a genuine, authentic community of kind people.\n\nI ordered the Jubani blend and honeycomb pastry, and they were divine! So far, those are my favorite items. Honorable mentions from others who've ordered here include the Yemeni Tea and Adeni Chai--both are delicious! I look forward to trying more of their menu items."

There are tons of tables inside and about six or eight tables outside. The ordering system is pretty simple. There's paper menus along with a menu on the wall. I like that they have regular espresso and cappuccino drinks along with Middle Eastern specialties. I tried the Jubani with evaporated milk. It was absolutely delicious. I also had the honeycomb and the Sabaya pastries. Both were delicious. The employees were very friendly as well. I thought the prices were fair. Will absolutely go back again!"

It feels like it's going to be such a great spot to chill and enjoy some good coffee and sweets! Definitely check it out!"

From the moment I walked in, the warm and welcoming atmosphere made me feel right at home. The decor is beautiful and cozy, creating the perfect spot to relax or catch up with friends.\n\nThe Yemeni coffee is truly exceptional--rich, flavorful, and brewed to perfection. Their unique blend of spices is something you won't find anywhere else. I also loved their pastries and snacks, which paired wonderfully with the coffee.\n\nThe staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and eager to ensure that every guest has a great experience. It's clear they take pride in what they do, and it shows in every detail.\n\nIf you're in Charlotte and looking for a place with incredible coffee, a great vibe, and outstanding service, Qahwa House is a must-visit. I can't wait to go back!"
