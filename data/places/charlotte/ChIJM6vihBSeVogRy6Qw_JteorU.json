When I brought this to the staff's attention and requested to speak with a manager, I expected concern and immediate action. Instead, I was met with indifference and unprofessionalism.\nFood safety should be a top priority for any establishment, especially one that prides itself on quality. The lack of concern from the management was unacceptable. This kind of negligence could lead to severe health consequences, especially for children.\nWhole Foods, I urge you to take this issue seriously. Proper food preparation and customer safety should never be overlooked. I hope to see accountability and improvement so that no other family has to experience this.\nSTAY AWAY FROM WHOLEFOOD\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?"

All I wanted was hot soup and a sandwich, or some hot prepared food as we are in a hotel with no microwave. The soup station and the little hot bar were empty. The coffee counter was closed for good? We weren't sure.\n\nThe salad bar was a mess. Most of the food trays were reduced to some dry bits, or had obviously been sitting out, untended, for hours.. there was a big plop of hummus that was literally turning a crusty brown on top and the edges. The dressing bottles were covered in slopped over dressing. I picked up the vinaigrette and it almost slipped out of my hands. There weren't any napkins, so I eventually wiped my hands on the counter just to get the grease off them. There was a small selection of hot things that looks like they were warmed over and put out - hours ago. Completely unappetizing.\n\nI walked out with a cup of romaine lettuce, a couple of grapes and grape tomatoes, and some picked onions - but yeah, no dressing. That and a bottle of iced tea cost $8. I know it's very expensive to eat there so I was fine paying a lot of money for tasty food. 100% disappointed."

Every single time we go shopping, we find produce just rotting on the shelves. And the pattern continues, with half of the purchase rotting in the fridge within a day or two. And no, it's not because it's organic, we buy a mix of conventional and organic.\n- the hot bar - the sizzler has a better selection and quality. Selection is abysmal and on multiple occasions I've gotten food that is undercooked or spoiled (tasted and smelled sour). I'm not even mentioning the food that is dry and crusty bc it's been sitting out for hours.\n- bakery items are subpar at best. Pastries are almost always undercooked, and why don't they slice bread for customers anymore?\n- grocery shelves are half empty and items are out of stock for weeks.\n- lastly, I'd like to comment on the poor workers, who are lifeless, clearly overwhelmed and overworked and sometimes rude and frustrated. Why does it take 20 minutes to get some cheese sliced at the deli? I don't blame them, I blame the management, because it is so evident that the managers are apathetic to workers needs.\nFarewell WFM and congratulations to Amazon for ruining a good thing."

The prominent and most stocked brand in a white packaging is of course (WFM). You will NOT find a variety of other known brands. Watermelon in a 32oz container was $17. Thats no typo folks, they wanted your girl to pay $17 of her coins for watermelon. Ok not going to lie. i considered it. Presentation looked fresh  sweet and ripe, and though everyone i made eye contact and smiled at, readily returned a warm and friendly smile. The only other persons that look like me was my companion and the cashier? I think they heard about the price of Watermelon  at Whole Foods Market.  Oh and my drinkable (Siggi's) yogurt   VERY reasonably priced. "

None of the number added up and no one could explain to me how they got to that price when numbers we were looked at didn't work. 2+2 did not equal 4!! They said customer service will know name and number of district manager.\nBEWARE of that call center because they just don't get it. It's not a language barrier as I was born in that country but grew up in the US bi explained it to them in their language the best I could but they just weren't getting it!\nI don't know how they do business!! It is the worst experience I've ever had spending $800 in a retail establishment and I can't get a correct answer!!  Avoid the off shore customer service at all cost!!

The clerk told him to walk to his car and get it.  He had maybe 10 items.  8 minutes later he comes back.   I told her I would gladly scan my card so he can have the prime specials. But no.  Holdup the line for 10 minutes while we wait so he can save a $1.00. He had 10 items for gods sake.  Geeze. This is the stupidity you deal with at the checkout.\n\nToday a produce employee was stocking carrots.  I asked him if they were out of limes as there were none out   He looked at the empty shelf and said we are out. We don't have any. He made no effort to look in the back.  5 minutes later he sees a box with limes.  Oh hey, here are some limes! You're in luck.  OMG.\n\nHere's another annoying thing it seems  they will charge an item incorrectly charging you organic when it's not.  especially lemons and avocados. It happened today on my lemon.  It had a scan sticker with the number but they charged me organic price.  I watch the price on the monitor while they scan my items or check my receipt before I head out.  They have no way of returning your money over the phone.  You have to remember to take your receipt back on your next visit.  How convenient for Whole Foods.\n\nMy experience with management is they are disinterested in your feedback. When I say something they look at me like I have a third eye.   I personally think it's a management issue at the CLT store.\n\nThey need to talk with Harris Teeter as they truly get customer service.  Harris Teeter is working on their organic food section    When they do I will never step foot back into Whole Foods.  Their employees lack of enthusiasm and good customer service is maddening to me.  They can do better.  Frankly, Whole Foods is too expensive.\n\nBtw, you can call Harris Teeter and they will refund your overcharges right over the phone.  They get it."

The bread section is poor, little variety and the few fresh breads they bake are always out. The penut butter machine is always empty and if you request for it to be filled, no peanuts and they look at you as you are NUTS. Produce during Thanksgiving was old.

Normal person wasn't there so I was told I could, and it would be charged as a whole pizza (about $17-$18). Before the person filling in handed it to me, pizza guy cam back and said they can't do that and said it would actually about $6 more and would be charged as individual slices.

What are these cashiers on? They need some customer service training. Like many say, watch out. They are rude to disabled people, I've seen it myself at the uptown location asking a disabled customer if they could read. It's pitiful. Their competition like Harris teeter and Publix offer stellar service."

I've been trying to solve this problem for two months now, but nothing works out, they blatantly lie and hypocrite in your eyes, and no one does anything.  Maybe whole foods makes a profit this way, I would not like to believe in it.

You wouldn't think that a grocery store is an excellent place to hang out, but this Whole Food is a staple for many.\n\nAs a grocery store it is very clean, organized, and has high quality products. For daily shopping I find it to be too expensive and would really only shop there to get specialty items like vegan or vegetarian supplements. The wine and beer selection is decent, but other stores have a bigger selection. The staff has always been friendly and helpful which I appreciate. The bar keep is always on point too which helps."
