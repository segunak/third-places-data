There\u2019s plenty of indoor seating as well as an outdoor space.\n\nMy boyfriend and I both had a cocktail, each were very unique and yummy. The bartender was very willing to make any and all accommodations to the drinks to ensure that we enjoyed. We also had the pimento cheese dip which I will honestly be thinking about until I get a chance to return.\n\nMy boyfriend made a reservation (Thursday night),  but it doesn\u2019t seem like it was needed or like the staff was concerned about reservations. Not a problem at all, but it just didn\u2019t seem like the reservation was necessary :)\n\nGreat place to visit for a casual happy hour or date night!",

We made a reservation one Saturday and once sat, waited over 20 minutes before we decided to leave since no one had been to the table. The GM graciously reached out to correct the issue and offered a free drink if we returned. Unfortunately when we returned a week later, her line went cold and the offer wasn't actually upheld. When we returned we waited 15 minutes before we even got a menu and water but once a server saw us we were good. Shout out Michelle! Once we got our drinks, they were very delicious and beautifully presented.\n\nUnfortunately I feel like chiefs needs better service and organization before it can be a true cocktail staple. Better cocktail places in NODA include oh my soul (right next door) and idle wodle (8 minute walk).",

I ordered the cynar boulevardier off the classic menu. It was ok. Nothing special and not anything I couldn't also get at any other bar in noda/villa/optimist for $14. Cynar isn't special anymore, and not to sound like a jerk which I'm sure I do, hasn't been special for a decade now. Also it's made with mid level 1792 bourbon and mid level vermouth so really just feels like a big swing and miss price wise. My wife got a drink off the special menu and the mix of \"popcorn and sherry\"  just didn't work for either of us. I hate being negative to a local business, but the prices are way out of alignment with the service and atmosphere. It's not that the service/atmosphere was bad, but to charge $19 for a drink, you need to differentiate yourself from all nearby competitors. I better leave feeling impressed by everything and this time I didn't. We ate no food on our visit, just decided to go to growlers instead after the two drinks just didn't leave us wanting anymore.",

We highly recommend stopping by for a pregame before a show at the Muse as we did or pre-dinner at some of the fabulous restaurants in Noda. There is no parking lot, so only street parking or paid parking decks a few blocks away. We recommend walking or ride share so you can enjoy the yummy cocktails. I heard the cookies are amazing, but since I'm the bitter lady declined on the deserts.",

We enjoyed hearing from him about the clarifying process that produced the Rise and Grind cocktail I had which tasted like a creamy espresso martini, but was actually coffee infused clear whisky! The clarified malted milk punch was also clear and had an aroma of a spiced apple cider and was delicious. The Pisco Sour had a rich, thick and creamy bergamot foam on the top that was so tasty! We sat in front of the fire on a cold February evening enjoying drinks and the toasted focaccia. Other patrons were friendly and conversational, our server Jackie was patient, friendly and so helpful and I hugged Bob when I left knowing confidently I would be back.

I expected nothing less than amazing cocktails when I visited, yet I still felt incredibly impressed by what I sipped on. Cheif\u2019s is an absolute-must stop for drinks before dinner. I\u2019d recommend reservations right now, since it\u2019s very popular with its recent opening.\n\nFavorite sips: Rise & Grind with espresso-washed Southern Star White Whiskey; it was super silky on the palate and such a fun take on a basic espresso martini.

I have to say after my first visit to Chiefs I suspect they may be working a few things out still, having only recently opened. Firstly, the service is great, no complaints there. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and attentive. To offer some gentle feedback, the drinks were made with quality ingredients but were over diluted. This could have been a one off, but it was noticeable across different cocktails. The atmosphere is generally nice. There is a some seating by a fire place that seems absolutely lovely. Sitting at the bar though, I was distracted by the large flat screen TV. For me, it took me out of the cozy, craft cocktail bar experience. Finally, I do think the price point is maybe a bit too high compared to what other bars in the cocktail scene are offering. It has a lot of potential and I would give it another try in 6+ months.",

It's decorated beautifully with sentimental pieces that are dear to the owner's heart.\n\nDrinks were phenomenal. House-made syrups compliment the spirits perfectly and the origin stories of each beverage are almost as good as the drinks! The devil is in the details and Bob doesn't skip a beat!!\n\nThe beautiful bar and highly skilled staff create a smooth flow to the night. You forget that you only had an hour reservation and find yourself chatting, laughing, and just hanging out. The snacks are amazing and work perfectly with the drinks. I mean, fresh cookies?!?!?\n\nHighly recommend stopping at Chief's for a great drink before dinner or to top off your night. 100% 10/10 will return repeatedly.",

He gave us food and drink recommendations around town, and swapped stories with us along the way.\n\nLong story short, Bob, Rob, and others made some amazing cocktails for us, while bringing us into the whole experience.

The cozy but classy decor makes this place such a good spot, you can tell a lot of hard (heart) work went into it. The service was knowledgeable and attentive. The cocktails were amazing, things I never tried before like a cheerwine cocktail. We enjoyed some warm cookies while visiting! Can\u2019t wait for summer and to use the outdoor patio. It is a bit on the more expensive side but it is truly an art form what the owner has created! So keep that in mind.",

The bartender was very willing to make any and all accommodations to the drinks to ensure that we enjoyed. We also had the pimento cheese dip which I will honestly be thinking about until I get a chance to return.\n\nMy boyfriend made a reservation (Thursday night),  but it doesn\u2019t seem like it was needed or like the staff was concerned about reservations. Not a problem at all, but it just didn\u2019t seem like the reservation was necessary :)\n\nGreat place to visit for a casual happy hour or date night!",

We made a reservation one Saturday and once sat, waited over 20 minutes before we decided to leave since no one had been to the table. The GM graciously reached out to correct the issue and offered a free drink if we returned. Unfortunately when we returned a week later, her line went cold and the offer wasn't actually upheld. When we returned we waited 15 minutes before we even got a menu and water but once a server saw us we were good. Shout out Michelle! Once we got our drinks, they were very delicious and beautifully presented.\n\nUnfortunately I feel like chiefs needs better service and organization before it can be a true cocktail staple. Better cocktail places in NODA include oh my soul (right next door) and idle wodle (8 minute walk).",

I ordered the cynar boulevardier off the classic menu. It was ok. Nothing special and not anything I couldn't also get at any other bar in noda/villa/optimist for $14. Cynar isn't special anymore, and not to sound like a jerk which I'm sure I do, hasn't been special for a decade now. Also it's made with mid level 1792 bourbon and mid level vermouth so really just feels like a big swing and miss price wise. My wife got a drink off the special menu and the mix of \"popcorn and sherry\"  just didn't work for either of us. I hate being negative to a local business, but the prices are way out of alignment with the service and atmosphere. It's not that the service/atmosphere was bad, but to charge $19 for a drink, you need to differentiate yourself from all nearby competitors. I better leave feeling impressed by everything and this time I didn't. We ate no food on our visit, just decided to go to growlers instead after the two drinks just didn't leave us wanting anymore.",

Adorable and welcoming house, comfortable but classy decor. We went early on a Sunday and sat at the bar. We didn't have reservations, but it is recommended especially at peak times. We tried several cocktails and small plates to share. All our servers were professional, knowledgeable and friendly...Sean, Lee and Rob (photo of Rob in the amazing light at sunset). We highly recommend stopping by for a pregame before a show at the Muse as we did or pre-dinner at some of the fabulous restaurants in Noda. There is no parking lot, so only street parking or paid parking decks a few blocks away. We recommend walking or ride share so you can enjoy the yummy cocktails. I heard the cookies are amazing, but since I'm the bitter lady declined on the deserts.",

We enjoyed hearing from him about the clarifying process that produced the Rise and Grind cocktail I had which tasted like a creamy espresso martini, but was actually coffee infused clear whisky! The clarified malted milk punch was also clear and had an aroma of a spiced apple cider and was delicious. The Pisco Sour had a rich, thick and creamy bergamot foam on the top that was so tasty! We sat in front of the fire on a cold February evening enjoying drinks and the toasted focaccia. Other patrons were friendly and conversational, our server Jackie was patient, friendly and so helpful and I hugged Bob when I left knowing confidently I would be back. If you\u2019re looking for unique and tasty drinks coupled with a warm friendly atmosphere, check out Chief\u2019s- guarantee you love it!",

I expected nothing less than amazing cocktails when I visited, yet I still felt incredibly impressed by what I sipped on. Cheif\u2019s is an absolute-must stop for drinks before dinner. I\u2019d recommend reservations right now, since it\u2019s very popular with its recent opening.\n\nFavorite sips: Rise & Grind with espresso-washed Southern Star White Whiskey; it was super silky on the palate and such a fun take on a basic espresso martini. Clarified Malted Milk Punch; it was so silky on the palate with nostalgic holiday flavors\n\nDid you know it\u2019s in a 121-year-old mill home in NoDa next to Goodyear House? So cool!",

I have to say after my first visit to Chiefs I suspect they may be working a few things out still, having only recently opened. Firstly, the service is great, no complaints there. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and attentive. To offer some gentle feedback, the drinks were made with quality ingredients but were over diluted. This could have been a one off, but it was noticeable across different cocktails. The atmosphere is generally nice. There is a some seating by a fire place that seems absolutely lovely. Sitting at the bar though, I was distracted by the large flat screen TV. For me, it took me out of the cozy, craft cocktail bar experience. Finally, I do think the price point is maybe a bit too high compared to what other bars in the cocktail scene are offering. It has a lot of potential and I would give it another try in 6+ months.",

It's decorated beautifully with sentimental pieces that are dear to the owner's heart.\n\nDrinks were phenomenal. House-made syrups compliment the spirits perfectly and the origin stories of each beverage are almost as good as the drinks! The devil is in the details and Bob doesn't skip a beat!!\n\nThe beautiful bar and highly skilled staff create a smooth flow to the night. You forget that you only had an hour reservation and find yourself chatting, laughing, and just hanging out. The snacks are amazing and work perfectly with the drinks. I mean, fresh cookies?!?!?\n\nHighly recommend stopping at Chief's for a great drink before dinner or to top off your night. 100% 10/10 will return repeatedly.",

He gave us food and drink recommendations around town, and swapped stories with us along the way.\n\nLong story short, Bob, Rob, and others made some amazing cocktails for us, while bringing us into the whole experience.

The cozy but classy decor makes this place such a good spot, you can tell a lot of hard (heart) work went into it. The service was knowledgeable and attentive. The cocktails were amazing, things I never tried before like a cheerwine cocktail. We enjoyed some warm cookies while visiting! Can\u2019t wait for summer and to use the outdoor patio. It is a bit on the more expensive side but it is truly an art form what the owner has created! So keep that in mind.",
