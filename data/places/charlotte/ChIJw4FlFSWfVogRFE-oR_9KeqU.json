Night: Music is way too loud! Machines can be janky!\n\nMy rating expectation: overall a 3 to not hurt the overall score too bad as we still love this place just a lot less! Service is a 5/5 everyone who works there does such an amazing job! Atmosphere is a 2/5 right in the middle of how I feel about day and night!\n\nWe found this place about 3 years ago or so and LOVED coming like every other weekend! This all really sucks as Pins is really the only pin ball place in Charlotte!\n\nLet's start with the day 1/5:\n\nWe haven't been to Pins in about a month as the music is a big turn off for us we have to be in the right type of mood to even think about tolerating it. (More on why with the night section) we were so excited to check out the atmosphere and hopefully start coming more like we used too every other week sometime every week!\nWe were very surprised and shocked at what we walked into I felt like I had stepped into a Chuck-E-Cheese. There were so many kids and we knew you guys allowed children past a certain debatable time at night. (More in the night section) but we were expecting day drinking and pin ball not a full blown playground! There was maybe 3 machines open to play and with all the ruckus it makes me wonder why a lot of the machines have seemed janky the last 5 times we've been. So unfortunately we won't be back during the day!\n\nNow for the night 3/5:\nThe service is always a 5/5 however sometime during the spring of last year the music has been ungodly loud we normally can't hear ourselves think I normally leave with a headache! It's not even that great of music either. I've also seen children still there as late as 11pm which is a major turn off as i didn't enjoy stepping away from the bar only to see a child late at night! The pinball machines have always been kinda janky the last five times we've been some stuck or just won't work! We will overall still come at nights just once every in a blue moon! As the atmosphere changed and I'd unfortunately no longer for us!\n\nWhat we would love to see:\nChild free days (not everyday but like a special once a month)\nLower music volumes (literally only a few notches down)\n\nAlso if you ever wanna sell a machine I might be interested!"

The service from all the staff was excellent, always polite and quick! the cocktails were really dialed in as well. Really well-rounded on that front for sure.\n\nMy wife's company had their office Christmas party here. To preface, I try to put constructive feedback in my reviews and leave out things that cant be controlled.\n\nMy main issues were that the food was mediocre, drinking water was \"over the bar\" only, the skee ball machines which occupied a large portion of the event space didn't work correctly (scoring was almost completely broken), and the event space was not effectively access restricted.\n\nMultiple people not involved with the event wandered through, one of whom appeared to be homeless and disoriented. Some people were even playing the arcade games in our event space. Adding a few more signs that say \"reserved for event- do not enter\" would probably be helpful, as well as making the tape barriers more obstructive.\n\nWater being over-the-bar only seems petty, but other bars in south end even have self-serve water set out for regular evenings. Unless this is some health code issue, in my opinion a water cooler would have bumped this up a notch.\n\nAnd finally the food- frankly it left a lot to be desired. There were some cold cut sliders, but apart from that It felt like a lot of the dishes were trying too hard. The bbq meatballs were yummy; other than that there was nothing really simple, no American staples like popcorn chicken or pulled pork, and some dishes like the teriyaki shrimp skewers were flat out bad in my opinion. Instead of normal fruit salad, there were assorted semi-soft cheeses added onto the ends of the fruit skewers, one of which was a classically \"smelly\" variety. I and other event goers i talked to mainly wanted simple, good food."

Side note* I respect that an arcade usually draws the attention of kids however since it is a BAR I thought parents would just take their kids to big air or something more appropriate and a lot of parents have been drinking and don't seem tocare if they run around. * I wish they served like personal pizzas, burgers/fries, mozzarella sticks. Nothing crazy. They do have partnerships with local food trucks so some good options come around from time to time."

I just went this week for my first time back in a couple years and WOW have they improved their entertainment. Plenty of pinball which is my favorite. They are not known as a pinball hall so their machines dont have the best care given to them and some tables have non-working gamemodes. They have games or activities for everybody. Plenty of seating/couches. Free cabinet arcade games, cornhole is free, etc. Duckpin is a little costly but for what you get (full 10 frames) and up to 7 people per lane, its worth the price. Drinks are priced pretty average for the CLT area. Theres so much to do for anybody and you cant have a bad night here. They also have a great upstairs patio with firepits, another bar, and a fantastic view of the city and sunset at the right time. Worth the drive from Rock Hill to visit. Love Pins "

This place is a hotspot for the younger generation, offering a wide range of activities that everyone can enjoy. My favorite was the bowling, which is not only fun but also reasonably priced compared to other bowling alleys. There are so many other games to play, including ping pong, corn hole, swings, a large enclosed slide, and various arcade games. The atmosphere is lively and perfect for hanging out with friends.\n\nOne of the best features is the bar, which allows you to bring your drinks to the play area. It's great to be able to enjoy a drink while playing games with friends. However, there is one drawback - after 8 PM, they require a physical ID for entry. This policy can be inconsistent, as sometimes they accept virtual IDs, but other times they don't. Unfortunately, on my last visit, my friend was not allowed in because she only had a virtual ID, which was quite disappointing.\n\nDespite this issue, I still think Pins Mechanical Co. is an excellent place to hang out with friends and have a good time. The variety of activities and the fun atmosphere make it worth visiting. Just make sure to bring a physical ID if you're planning to stay late!"

The next morning I contact her back to confirm the rooftop and she was a different person. She proceeded to tell me that was too expensive for me and I couldn't have a DJ among other things. I cancelled everything immediately and emailed the corporate managers. No one got back to me from the entire company. I was disappointed yet not surprise. Do not use the place for any events.

I really thought the whole intention behind this place was a \"fun social house style bar with games and even a slide(!) for adults to feel like kids again!\" Well the last time we went, my friend and I struggled to even go down the slide because there were about 8 tiny children running UP it. We sat at the top for a good 5 minutes using our best teacher voices to warn them we were coming down and make sure they were out of the way. And yet I still pummeled one over on my way down??? This child smacked their head and ran off crying!! Nah. Not the vibe. We also couldn't play any other games in the place other than the pinball machines because they were all taken over by 10 year-olds. The wait for duck-pin was 2.5 hours! So last stop was to wait for a turn at playing skee ball, but lo-and-behold we also couldn't do that because the children literally wouldn't share a turn when we asked them. It's wild out there y'all. This is truly the new Chucky Cheese. Have fun."

Bartenders make it easy to put in orders wherever you are. Got a lane for duckpin bowling which is so fun!!! Much smaller ball and the shots per frame. The pins have ropes going up so they will fall over but when it resets it clears the knocked pins the rope retracts and sets the unknocked pins back up and keep the ones you hit up out of the way. Slides, swings, giant beer pong made it feel like a big ol playground. So much fun! Definitely recommend!!"

I thought that it wasn't required until later that night, when the pin pad was given to me to select for a tip and receipt when I ordered from a different bartender. I checked my bank account later on in the evening and I was charged way more for the one drink than the other. Could've been a mistake, but it also happened to my other friend, and I emailed corporate who gave me the receipt. The bartender ADDED HIS OWN TIP IN. He took advantage of me and also likely my other friend I was with, as she was also overcharged. Absolutely awful to have to worry about a bartender stealing from you. Be careful and make sure to see the pin pad and ask for a receipt when ordering here, and check your bank account afterwards!! Not sure if it's just the one bartender or maybe others do it too. Unacceptable and outright ridiculous. It's by definition stealing from your customers. Thank you corporate for taking care of this and giving me a refund on my tip, as well as ensuring that the situation will be handled, but it's not even about the money, it's about a bartender stealing because he thinks he can take advantage. Just putting this out there to warn others!! Saw another review from a bit ago that said something similar too. As someone who worked in the service industry, I understand tipping very well, and TAKING YOUR OWN IS STEALING!!!!"

            "review_text": "Staff was nice and cordial, but there are a number of logistical problems with this place.  1) They sacrifice a quarter of their parking lot to reserve spots for food trucks.  I'm not talking when trucks are there, but off peak times when there are no food trucks there and the parking could be useful.  2) Most machines require quarters or singles. Not a problem, I'll go break a $100 at the bar and get a drink and change.  Nope, bar is cashless.  Ok, I'll go to the rental desk.  Nope, we only have singles. Well, then obviously the change machines take credit cards.  Nope, you have to use the ATM to get a bill small enough for the change machine.  Naturally the change machine next to the ATM is broken, so I have to go to the furthest spot in the arcade from that point to get quarters. 3) None of the newer pinball machines are leveled/tuned correctly, nor are they online, even though they have the equipment to do so. 4) Arcades are not well maintained (joysticks reading inputs incorrectly, falling apart, etc.).\n\nThere are other activities to do around the bar and they look fun.  I guess most people are satisfied with those, but when half of your floor space is dedicated to pins and arcade games, I would expect better care to be given to that part of the business.  However, I did notice they said all quarter drops go to Ronald McDonald, so maybe they don't care as much about that since it doesn't appear to be a revenue stream."

I think there are 3 games which cost to play. They also serve drinks and there is always a food truck outside. It's a great place for families during the day,  as they have swings,  firepits and a two-story sliding board. The only thing I don't like is the restroom setup. We are in a different climate in the world. There is street parking and a small parking lot down the street."

I was told that the other worker \"lied\" about being able to use this bathroom.\n\nI'm from New England and I've never had this happen to me. Almost every place I've been to in New England allows you to use the bathroom especially when the place is still open. They're also consistent about checking IDs. This is ridiculous and you all should be ashamed. This happened at approximately 2 am. I will not be returning and will be sure to make sure friends and family and the readers who read my reviews avoid this type of place. Consistency is key."
