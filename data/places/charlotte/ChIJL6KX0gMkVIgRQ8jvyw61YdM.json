The last several times I've gone to the Matthews library to check out a book I had to wait over a month for one to become available. I'm not talking about some rare book with only a few copies in print, these were popular books with millions of copies in print worldwide, just not here apparently. Both times I ended up ordering the books on Amazon for less than $20 and they arrived at my house in a few days.  Perfect example, for one particular resource I am currently #45 on the waitlist for 25 available copies. Charlotte Mecklenburg Library is quickly becoming irrelevant in my opinion."

Both of my children have at various times participated in Storytimes and the Active Reading programs. The resources for individuals and families are excellent. The librarians I've spoken with have always been enthusiastic and helpful. I appreciate having such an excellent library in my community. Thank you so much!"
