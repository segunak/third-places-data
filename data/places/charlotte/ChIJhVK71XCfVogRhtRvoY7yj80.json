We arrived, ordered, sat and didn't wait too long for our food and drinks.\n\nMy shareable salad was nice, but small in the context of sharing. The avocado toast was soft on soft - the bread seemed to be toasted on one side but was still quite soft, with the avocados mashed or sliced - it wasn't clear -, and then drenched in a sauce. The plate('ing) was quite awkward but overall not as enjoyable as desired. Nice biscuit, but the sides - butter and jam were way more than needed.\n\nMy daughter's drink had a bug. Once I brought it to their notice, the team was kind enough to replace it, and refund the drink."

The staff are friendly and given the limited seating available, do a fantastic job of making sure tables are shared (when appropriate), people don't sit before ordering and people don't linger too long. The ambiance is second to none; it's a relaxed, cozy, communal vibe that can't be beat. So glad to have rediscovered this gem!"

I feel like this system doesn't work though, because everyone stands in the same line to order...but you only get a table if one is open the instant you place your order so that you can get a number. You're either lucky or not...there's no in between. For a coffee shop/cafe, it seems too strict. People should be able to sit as they like as tables open up.\nStaff were nice and food was good but felt overpriced ($8 for a pop tart that I waited on for 15mins).\nI wanted to like this place and may give it another try, but I didn't love it due to the  $ and weird seating rules."

My wife ordered a latte and enjoyed it so much she grabbed another to take home.\n\n2.  The breakfast sandwiches taste great but are a little overpriced.  We ordered turkey sausage, egg, and cheese croissant and it was $9.50 each.  Had we had bacon (we don't eat pork) our sandwiches would have been $5.65.    The avocado toast was pretty good however it was soggy and may have had a bit too much butter.  It wasn't bad, but yet again.  It was $10.  All in all we paid about $47 for 2 croissant sandwiches, avocado toast, an orange juice, and 2 coffees.   When visiting here you are obviously paying for the location.  Our order probably should. Have been $30 tops.\n\n3.  The service was really good.  They take your order when you arrive and you seat yourself.  However, a waitress will bring out your food and drinks and check in on you occasionally.  Our waitress was friendly and did a good job of making sure we were happy.\n\n4.  The dining area is cozy with a few high top tables.  There are live plants and overall really relaxed vibe.  The downfall is the space can fill up very quickly.  If 5 or 6 orders come in back to back the place will fill up very quickly.  When we visited it was rainy but they do have quite a bit of outdoor seating.  They also provide free WiFi.\n\n4. The parking is horrible! Street parking seems to be the best option.  There is a parking deck across the street but I'm not sure if that deck is public parking."

Their drip coffee is also very good.\nThe B.E.L.T. consistently ranks among the best sandwiches I've had. It's a simple, no gimmicks, BLT plus an egg. What makes it excel is that every ingredient is flavorful and contributes to the sandwich. The bread (sourdough I think) has a good chew. The tomatoes are flavourful and ripe. The deep golden yolk of a good egg provides umami goodness. The bacon is salty but not overpowering. Finally the greens are fresh and give a slight bitterness that brings out the rest. I'll leave something to the imagination and not provide details on the mayo (hint: it's also very good)"

My family quietly stepped aside to wait for service only to experience blatant rejection.   Gratefully a different employee saw what was happening and offered to seat us immediately and released us to place an order.   Thanks for the allyship!  We left the place, nonetheless, after the same cashier told us that none of our food selections were available.\n\nWe will NEVER patronize this place again.  Please require your employees to take bias courses.\nSuch a waste since the food looked like it would have been tasty.\n\nSo sad that we are in 2022 still experiencing the effects of 1965.

Bad idea.\n\n1st issue - I wasn't acknowledged or greeted.\n\nI was sitting for about 5 minutes when an employee came up to me and rudely told me that they were getting busy and that the customers in line will need a place to sit. You have to order food and THEN sit. She walked away before I could respond.\n\nI called her back over to my table to let her know I had every intention on ordering, was just waiting for my guest so that we could order together. Which is a thing right? Sometimes one party arrives before the other and they usually wait to order together?\n\nFor added context, the cafe had plenty of seating when I arrived. They did get a bit of a rush moments later.\n\nIf I had been sitting for an unreasonable amount of time I could understand politely asking a guest what their intentions are as we are getting busy and our tables are limited.\n\nBut her approach was terrible and gave off \"get out\" vibes.\n\nThankfully there was a bagel shop (Poppy's) right around the corner and my colleague and I ended up having the best food & service there!"

Once we started ordering, the individual at the front was nice, but not very accommodating. She didn't seem that invested in us as customers, which is fine, but just something I noticed and the only reason I left a 4 star review.\nThe food, however, is a whole other matter. My wife ordered the Smoked Salmon (a menu item) and I ordered the Breakfast Burrito (also a menu item).\nThe burrito was just the right size with a good amount of sausage and other fillings, but not overflowing. The flavor was excellent. The burrito was filling.\nAll-in-all, a great cafe worth a stop and a bite."

He sat down and then the servers just came to over to kick him out of his seat even though there was no one in sight waiting for a table. Literally no one looking at the table or wanting it. Anyone who ordered before us either found another table or left. They had the unmitigated gall to tell my husband that they needed free tables open for people who are sitting outside to come in in case it rains. Is that a joke? Disgusting.

My wife's salad again was tasty but she felt it didn't come together well. Getting good bites incorporating the different flavors was nearly impossible.

You order at the counter and seat yourself. I had the BELT and my husband had the special, which was shrimp and grits, and everything was fresh and delicious. I also had a peach sangria and an iced vanilla latte, both of which I really enjoyed. I'm glad we found a new brunch spot that isn't overrated or has a ridiculously long wait. Although it's a small space, there is plenty of seating (bar, tables, patio). It seems like a good place to hang out and work if you work from home like me. I'd like to give that a try soon."

My husband had the beef bowl and our son, who is super picky had the grilled chicken sandwich. Everything tasted great. Not crowded and friendly, attentive staff."

The menu had me flip-flopping between options, and what I ended up with was delicious! Only losing a star because of value. Prices were a little hefty for what you get, so if that's a deal-breaker for you, save this for a special occasion. Otherwise, I highly recommend this tucked away South End spot."
