They have effectively ruined my taste buds because no other coffee hits the same for me anymore. I also love trying their new and always unique flavor combos that their workers come up with (posted on one of their blackboards).  Everyone that works there is great, especially Skipper their doggy mascot who is almost always there and ready to welcome you in exchange for belly rubs."

Once the weather is cooler, we're excited to try new hot coffee drinks. The baked goods that they offer are always SO yummy.\nWe are so happy to have found this local gem of a coffee shop and will always support them! :)"

They are always genuinely happy and provide customers with the best customer service. I never feel like 'another transaction'. It's nice to have a local coffee place in Tega Cay / Fort Mill with great products and friendly customer service!\nThanks Tega Cay Coffee Co. for all you do!"

They offer the basic normal flavors and I didn't see any special lattes on the menu. I just ordered a vanilla latte and a caramel latte and honestly it tasted like something I can make at home. There was no unique flavor to the coffee. With so many coffee shops and coffee trucks these days, you have to do something to stand out. Offering some unique flavored lattes is one way to do that."
