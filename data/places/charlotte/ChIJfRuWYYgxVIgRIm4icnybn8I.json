I brushed it off and continue looking & as I got closer they were both on their phones just laughing and not even paying attention to their customers.

As another reviewer stated there is an overall vibe of cozy genre, young adult reads, classics and a wonderful assortment of elementary level book series. My teenagers were voracious readers until about 13 and I often hear their frustration in finding books that truly engage them. From my impression today I am hopeful this is a place that will have a wide variety of recommendations for this 13-18 age group to find engaging age appropriate novels that aren't TOO mature. A good selection of thoughtful gifts for all ages. Appreciated that it wasn't packed with too much inventory...there is space to breathe and feel calm as opposed to that overstimulated feeling common to many boutiques. I look forward to visiting again and hope to see frequent changes to gifts and books curated to the seasons/holidays.",

As another reviewer stated there is an overall vibe of cozy genre, young adult reads, classics and a wonderful assortment of elementary level book series. My teenagers were voracious readers until about 13 and I often hear their frustration in finding books that truly engage them. From my impression today I am hopeful this is a place that will have a wide variety of recommendations for this 13-18 age group to find engaging age appropriate novels that aren't TOO mature. A good selection of thoughtful gifts for all ages. Appreciated that it wasn't packed with too much inventory...there is space to breathe and feel calm as opposed to that overstimulated feeling common to many boutiques. I look forward to visiting again and hope to see frequent changes to gifts and books curated to the seasons/holidays.",
