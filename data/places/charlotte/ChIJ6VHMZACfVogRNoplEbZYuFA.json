The place was nicely done, smells amazing & staff were very attentive & their recommendations were spot on. Their desserts look scrumptious it was hard to pick which ones to order. Their Turkish & Saudi coffee were served in a traditional pot which added to the aesthetic. Their pistachio cake & bee bites were so yum, not sweet but just the right taste. The only reason for 4 stars : parking spot can be a challenge especially on a week day & space can be tight for a large group so take that into consideration. Overall, we had a great experience & will definitely be back soon",

The Dubai chocolate cronut was the most disappointing it was definitely old & so oily that it dripped down my wrists & the crunchy bits on the inside were dry & stale, & didn\u2019t taste like pistachio at all or chocolate for that matter there was no ganache or pistachio paste mixed in, so it was very dry. So the dry crunchy bits mixed with the insanely oily crust was very offputting. For as much as you charge, the pastries should be fresh\u2026 I\u2019m a professional Pastry Chef so I\u2019m very disappointed. Their marketing team made things look so good on Instagram.",

We were busy at that moment and he meant to redirect the call to ownership but inadvertently hung up. This has never happened before and certainly not how we treat every one of our guests. We are deeply sorry about your experience and would like to ask you to email ownership directly at HarazHollis@gmail.com. We hope to speak to you soon, Nia.\n\nHaraz Coffee House Ownership",

It\u2019s so hard to find but it\u2019s the most aromatic unique coffee you can get and trust me it\u2019s STRONG. They do it perfectly here. I also had to try the Harazi Mufawar classic coffee they do with cardamom and that was honestly my favorite. Perfect cozy fall flavor.\n\nThe snacks made me want to order nonstop but I controlled myself and just got the saffron milk cake and the classic bee bites. Both were delicious but my Fiance said the bee bites were the perfect mix of savory but subtle sweetness. Will be back for sure!",

I went in today and was being watched by an employee who followed me to let me know that I wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her in, to which I have 0 problems with, but it is pretty inconvenient since I\u2019ve asked on numerous occasions. I mentioned that he needed to tell the rest of the employees as I have been given conflicting responses and he gave me a snarky response.

The staff was very friendly and attentive upon entering, The atmosphere is just a vibe in itself and the coffee is beyond unique.\n\nI ordered the Biscoff Cheescake and Iced Haraz Latte. The Biscoff Cheesecake was creamy, light and had a delicious crunch.\nThe Haraz Latte was absolutely mouthwatering, the Haraz spice and honey blend perfectly together. It was a mix of strong espresso with a dash of sweetness.\n\nOverall, highly recommend trying this place out. Can\u2019t wait to try the Matcha next.",

The bakery section looked empty and the coffee was very disappointing. Maybe this kind of coffee is not in my flavor profile? I\u2019m not sure what it was. I ordered the Turkish coffee and the iced harazi which did not look like what I saw from online. The ladies were friendly I must say. In addition, I paid for parking. So, based off of this, I\u2019m not coming back.",

I was with my small French Bulldog \u2014 a calm, quiet, well-trained dog who is a certified service dog. He doesn\u2019t bark, doesn\u2019t run around, doesn\u2019t bother anyone, and knows all the commands. Honestly, he behaves better than many kids in public spaces.\n\nI\u2019ve been coming here with him many times before, and it was never an issue. In fact, I\u2019ve often seen other customers with dogs \u2014 even large breeds, and not service animals \u2014 and it was totally fine.\nBut today, we were simply turned away. I was told we could only get coffee to go \u2014 we weren\u2019t allowed to sit and enjoy it inside.\n\nHonestly, it felt hurtful and disappointing. In 2025, you\u2019d think we\u2019d have a better understanding of rights, laws, and basic human decency \u2014 especially when it comes to animals. Service animals are protected by law, and they shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that a place I used to love made it so clear today that I\u2019m no longer welcome. And no \u2014 it\u2019s not about the coffee.\ud83d\udc4e",

This situation does not reflect our values or our training, and we are taking steps to ensure it does not happen again.\n\nWe\u2019d love the opportunity to make this right. Please allow us to invite you back, and as a gesture of our sincere apology, we would like to offer you a gift card. If you\u2019re open to it, feel free to contact us directly at our phone number on our page so we can arrange this for you.\n\nThank you again for your feedback\u2014it helps us\n\nHaraz Management",

The tables are spread apart, so that you feel like you have room to move and aren\u2019t on top of your neighbor. The menu is more interesting than the average coffee shop. I had the Haraz Mufawar and it was delightful! It had just enough sweetness with some warm spices. Everything in the pastry case looked amazing. I ended up with a raspberry lemon cronut, which was messy, but amazing. The service was great- from the patience of the person taking my order to the person who delivered my order to the table,they were all friendly and efficient. I look forward to visiting this shop again!",

The decor down to the choice of silverware and glassware screams classy for a coffee shop. The vibe is very chill and relaxed.\n\nCoffee options were creative and flavorful. I would have never thought of adding cardamom and saffron to latte, but it works! It\u2019s a nice spot for folks with a sweet tooth as well. The sweets pair perfectly with their rich and robust coffee options! Staff is super friendly and helpful as well! Willing to answer questions about their coffee and give great recommendations.",

We're truly sorry to hear that your expectations weren\u2019t met and that you felt disappointed\u2014this is never the impression we want to leave.\n\nWe take great care in preparing our cakes fresh daily, but we clearly fell short during your visit. We\u2019re very sorry to hear that you felt unwell and hope you\u2019re feeling better now. We\u2019re looking into what might have gone wrong with the baking process that day, as quality and safety are extremely important to us.\n\nRegarding our service style, we operate with a counter-service model, which is why we call guests to pick up their orders and offer self-busing stations. Tipping is always optional, and we understand your concern\u2014we\u2019re working on better communicating our service approach so expectations are clearer from the start.\n\nYou're also right about the parking information\u2014we appreciate you pointing that out. We'll be updating our Google and website listings to include those details to avoid confusion in the future.\n\nWe really do value your feedback and hope you\u2019ll consider giving us another try.\n\nWarm Regards, \nHaraz Coffee House\n\n",

A large party had just left, and we were in the process of clearing their area. While we always aim to maintain a clean and welcoming environment, we clearly fell short this time.\n\nRegarding our team, one of the employees speaks only Arabic, which is why that language was being used. He had asked if he can go clean the table. That said, the level of service you received was not up to our standards, and we will be addressing this with our staff.\n\nWe\u2019re truly sorry for your experience and hope you\u2019ll consider giving us another chance. Please enjoy a complimentary drink on your next visit\u2014it\u2019s the least we can do.\n\nWarm regards,\nHaraz Coffee House\n",

It was definitely livelier than usual, and we understand how that may have made it hard to relax. We do our best to maintain a calm atmosphere, and we appreciate your patience during special events like this.\n\nAs for the Wi-Fi and phone signal, we completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve been dealing with ongoing issues from our internet provider, AT&T, and despite our efforts, the service has been unreliable. We're continuing to push for a resolution, but it has been out of our hands.\n\nWe truly hope you'll visit us again on a quieter day\u2014we\u2019d love the chance to give you the experience you were hoping for.\n\nWarm regards,\nHaraz Coffee House \n\n",

On top of that, she charged me more than usual and I didn\u2019t even notice until I got to work. Honestly, this might be the last time I ever go there. That\u2019s just sad.",

We were excited to check out their new South End location and it did not disappoint!\n\nOur go to is still the Mafowar cardamom and cream\u2014 bold, fragrant, and creamy with just the right touch of sweetness. We also devoured a variety of pastries, especially anything with pistachios (seriously, get them all). The brioche and the especially the one with strawberries was sold out by the time we got there around 3 pm. Our savory favorite was the pastry with a nod to the everything bagel \u2013 filled with cream cheese and feta and cheese, reminiscent of a warm, flaky borek. Absolutely delicious!\n\nThe South End space is beautiful, bright, and spacious\u2014perfect for working, studying, or casual networking. There is a warm, welcoming vibe, and the staff likes to go above and beyond to make us feel at home.\nI also asked about parking & great news: there\u2019s free parking for guests. Just scan the QR code at the counter and enter their voucher code for validation.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Yemeni coffee or just looking to try something different, Haraz Coffee is a must. and yes, you can even buy their beans to brew at home, which we highly recommend.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJosephine Local Guide",

The place was nicely done, smells amazing & staff were very attentive & their recommendations were spot on. Their desserts look scrumptious it was hard to pick which ones to order. Their Turkish & Saudi coffee were served in a traditional pot which added to the aesthetic. Their pistachio cake & bee bites were so yum, not sweet but just the right taste. The only reason for 4 stars : parking spot can be a challenge especially on a week day & space can be tight for a large group so take that into consideration. Overall, we had a great experience & will definitely be back soon",

Three phone calls and 2 stop bys later Haraz saved the day. The had not 1 but 3 different varieties. My husband left with a slice of 3 different pistachio desserts AND a pistachio latte. Needless to say he was sooo happy!! The guy at the register remembered me from my voice when I called and all I said was Hello upon entering and he knew it was me!! The coffee house was bright & inviting and quite spacious. There was even a closed off meeting space on the back side.",

So the dry crunchy bits mixed with the insanely oily crust was very offputting. For as much as you charge, the pastries should be fresh\u2026 I\u2019m a professional Pastry Chef so I\u2019m very disappointed. Their marketing team made things look so good on Instagram.",

The team member who answered the phone had no intentions of hanging up the phone. We were busy at that moment and he meant to redirect the call to ownership but inadvertently hung up. This has never happened before and certainly not how we treat every one of our guests. We are deeply sorry about your experience and would like to ask you to email ownership directly at HarazHollis@gmail.com. We hope to speak to you soon, Nia.\n\nHaraz Coffee House Ownership",

It\u2019s so hard to find but it\u2019s the most aromatic unique coffee you can get and trust me it\u2019s STRONG. They do it perfectly here. I also had to try the Harazi Mufawar classic coffee they do with cardamom and that was honestly my favorite. Perfect cozy fall flavor.\n\nThe snacks made me want to order nonstop but I controlled myself and just got the saffron milk cake and the classic bee bites. Both were delicious but my Fiance said the bee bites were the perfect mix of savory but subtle sweetness. Will be back for sure!",

The first time I visited, I made my friend wait outside with my dog to go in and ask if dogs were allowed (just for takeout coffee). I was told yes. Again the second time I did the same activity to double check to make sure it was ok, and was told it was fine as long as I was leaving and not sitting down. I went in today and was being watched by an employee who followed me to let me know that I wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her in, to which I have 0 problems with, but it is pretty inconvenient since I\u2019ve asked on numerous occasions. I mentioned that he needed to tell the rest of the employees as I have been given conflicting responses and he gave me a snarky response. Left a bad taste in my mouth and I hate that I won\u2019t be returning as the coffee is very good.",

It was a mix of strong espresso with a dash of sweetness.\n\nOverall, highly recommend trying this place out. Can\u2019t wait to try the Matcha next.",

I was with my small French Bulldog \u2014 a calm, quiet, well-trained dog who is a certified service dog. He doesn\u2019t bark, doesn\u2019t run around, doesn\u2019t bother anyone, and knows all the commands. Honestly, he behaves better than many kids in public spaces.\n\nI\u2019ve been coming here with him many times before, and it was never an issue. In fact, I\u2019ve often seen other customers with dogs \u2014 even large breeds, and not service animals \u2014 and it was totally fine.\nBut today, we were simply turned away. I was told we could only get coffee to go \u2014 we weren\u2019t allowed to sit and enjoy it inside.\n\nHonestly, it felt hurtful and disappointing. In 2025, you\u2019d think we\u2019d have a better understanding of rights, laws, and basic human decency \u2014 especially when it comes to animals. Service animals are protected by law, and they shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that a place I used to love made it so clear today that I\u2019m no longer welcome. And no \u2014 it\u2019s not about the coffee.\ud83d\udc4e",

This situation does not reflect our values or our training, and we are taking steps to ensure it does not happen again.\n\nWe\u2019d love the opportunity to make this right. Please allow us to invite you back, and as a gesture of our sincere apology, we would like to offer you a gift card. If you\u2019re open to it, feel free to contact us directly at our phone number on our page so we can arrange this for you.\n\nThank you again for your feedback\u2014it helps us\n\nHaraz Management",

The tables are spread apart, so that you feel like you have room to move and aren\u2019t on top of your neighbor. The menu is more interesting than the average coffee shop. I had the Haraz Mufawar and it was delightful! It had just enough sweetness with some warm spices. Everything in the pastry case looked amazing. I ended up with a raspberry lemon cronut, which was messy, but amazing. The service was great- from the patience of the person taking my order to the person who delivered my order to the table,they were all friendly and efficient. I look forward to visiting this shop again!",

We're truly sorry to hear that your expectations weren\u2019t met and that you felt disappointed\u2014this is never the impression we want to leave.\n\nWe take great care in preparing our cakes fresh daily, but we clearly fell short during your visit. We\u2019re very sorry to hear that you felt unwell and hope you\u2019re feeling better now. We\u2019re looking into what might have gone wrong with the baking process that day, as quality and safety are extremely important to us.\n\nRegarding our service style, we operate with a counter-service model, which is why we call guests to pick up their orders and offer self-busing stations. Tipping is always optional, and we understand your concern\u2014we\u2019re working on better communicating our service approach so expectations are clearer from the start.\n\nYou're also right about the parking information\u2014we appreciate you pointing that out. We'll be updating our Google and website listings to include those details to avoid confusion in the future.\n\nWe really do value your feedback and hope you\u2019ll consider giving us another try.\n\nWarm Regards, \nHaraz Coffee House\n\n",

A large party had just left, and we were in the process of clearing their area. While we always aim to maintain a clean and welcoming environment, we clearly fell short this time.\n\nRegarding our team, one of the employees speaks only Arabic, which is why that language was being used. He had asked if he can go clean the table. That said, the level of service you received was not up to our standards, and we will be addressing this with our staff.\n\nWe\u2019re truly sorry for your experience and hope you\u2019ll consider giving us another chance. Please enjoy a complimentary drink on your next visit\u2014it\u2019s the least we can do.\n\nWarm regards,\nHaraz Coffee House\n",

It was definitely livelier than usual, and we understand how that may have made it hard to relax. We do our best to maintain a calm atmosphere, and we appreciate your patience during special events like this.\n\nAs for the Wi-Fi and phone signal, we completely understand your frustration. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve been dealing with ongoing issues from our internet provider, AT&T, and despite our efforts, the service has been unreliable. We're continuing to push for a resolution, but it has been out of our hands.\n\nWe truly hope you'll visit us again on a quieter day\u2014we\u2019d love the chance to give you the experience you were hoping for.\n\nWarm regards,\nHaraz Coffee House \n\n",

Please note that our team members strictly adhere to Haraz Coffee House policies and treat every guest with respect.\n\nAfter reviewing the security cameras and discussing the matter with the team, we found that the employee provided you with respect and approached you in a respectful manner. \n\nRegarding your bill, you ordered an adeni medium pot. I checked your receipt and confirmed that you were charged correctly. The cashier had explained the details to you before you had left. If you have any other questions pertaining to it, I can gladly help.\n\nYou are always welcome to visit us anytime, and we\u2019ll be delighted to assist you in any way we can. \n\nThank you ",

We were excited to check out their new South End location and it did not disappoint!\n\nOur go to is still the Mafowar cardamom and cream\u2014 bold, fragrant, and creamy with just the right touch of sweetness. We also devoured a variety of pastries, especially anything with pistachios (seriously, get them all). The brioche and the especially the one with strawberries was sold out by the time we got there around 3 pm. Our savory favorite was the pastry with a nod to the everything bagel \u2013 filled with cream cheese and feta and cheese, reminiscent of a warm, flaky borek. Absolutely delicious!\n\nThe South End space is beautiful, bright, and spacious\u2014perfect for working, studying, or casual networking. There is a warm, welcoming vibe, and the staff likes to go above and beyond to make us feel at home.\nI also asked about parking & great news: there\u2019s free parking for guests. Just scan the QR code at the counter and enter their voucher code for validation.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Yemeni coffee or just looking to try something different, Haraz Coffee is a must. and yes, you can even buy their beans to brew at home, which we highly recommend.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJosephine Local Guide",
