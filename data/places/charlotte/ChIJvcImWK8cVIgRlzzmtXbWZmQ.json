I spoke to her at the end of the night and complimented the tea.  I mentioned how much for a refill, and she bless my heart and gave up her complementary shift drink. She truly was such a blessing.   It is always nice to meet kind, hard-working, workers, at coffee shops, who love their job.   Hats off to the kind young man who worked at the register last night because he was so very patient as we were trying to figure out our order. Love this place!\n"

Now it's all white , and sweet . Disgustingly sweet . I'm confused . Was the owner trying to make excuse for the baristas ? Or were you trying something new ? I use to buy the beans you used with the drinks !

Initially, I used to come here alone, but now I bring everyone along - my coworkers, mall management, my roommate, friends, and even my boyfriend. I visit multiple times a day, and I have no regrets!\n\nThe atmosphere here is amazing, and the place is always spotlessly clean. The baristas and owners are some of the friendliest and sweetest people you'll ever meet. They make everyone feel welcome and part of the community.\n\nI've even made some wonderful friends here, with Abby being one of the best. The strong AC and Wi-Fi make it a perfect place to hang out, work, or just relax. The other regulars are also fantastic and add to the welcoming vibe of the place.\n\nOne of the highlights is their summer menu, which features a latte that has become my all-time favorite. I honestly can't get enough of it - if it's not coffee from here, I don't want it!\n\nThey host a variety of events like bingo nights, karaoke nights, classes, and there's an upcoming trivia night that I can't wait to check out. Their Instagram content is hilarious and keeps me entertained between visits.\n\nI've even started collecting their merchandise - so far, I have a t-shirt and a mug, but I'm definitely planning to get more.\n\nThis place is also great for groups. Sometimes I come alone, but other times I host a small Bible study here, and it's always the perfect setting.\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic coffee/ice cream shop with a welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff, great events, and a wonderful community, this is the place to be. Highly recommend!"

The staff walked past the counter several times without any acknowledgement what so ever. There were 3 staff behind the counter. After we stood there for a good while, enough to realize they weren't gonna wait on us, I said excuse me, the girl turned around and said \"yeah?\". So rude. She wasn't very helpful at all. She replied with a sarcastic response. I felt upset and not appreciated or valued as a customer in their establishment. Will not be back, which is a shame because it looks like they sell some pretty great stuff, but based on how I was treated, I don't plan on finding out."

I used to enjoy visiting.\nIt has gone a little downhill. Tables are wobbly, they're very understaffed, and tables are not wiped up. They've added a kiosk for ordering, but it doesn't help much if they have a large menu and only 2 to 3 people behind the counter.

I don't think 'fill half the cup with water' is confusing. When I tried to explain to them that they can just empty half the cup and put another shot in they exclaimed to be very confused as if I was speaking another language.

Perc also offers Jags Head, and while I don't prefer their proprietary blend, I LOVE the coffee from their Finca el Cipres farm; it's one of my favorite roasts available in the Charlotte area. Furthermore, Perc offers excellent traditional espresso drinks as well as deliciously creative crafts, even letting the baristas have a say in creations.\n\nHowever, there are still some qualms I have with the shop. Most notably, I wish the owner would focus more of his energy on doing coffee EXTREMELY well; I don't understand the eclectic assortment of random goods spews across the shop, and I doubt it turns enough of a profit to warrant the space it takes up. No one comes to perc for soap, pasta, popcorn, or lotion, so quit pouring resources into those things. I get it: Sean wants to support local businesses, and I do too! But support local businesses that are in/complimenting your industry. The daily pastries and truffles are great.\n\nUltimately, there's a reason I come back every once in a while. The owner knows what he's doing, but he'd still benefit from sitting down and acting upon what his staff and loyal customer base have to say."

I'm not sure what her name was, but I went to have some icecream with my mother and and we both agreed the clerk was very attentive, kind and sweet.\n\nThe atmosphere was very cool, and had a chic modern cafe feel with 1920's decor. It felt cozy and to top it off, the ice cream brownie sundae we had was absolutely incredible. This place hit all the marks. I didn't realize such a great place was so close to my home. I'll definitely be back"

Besides, I also ordered a cinnamon roll that tasted very homemade and of course delicious  but what I liked the most was my matcha latte with white chocolate and lavender, it's one of THE BEST matchas I've ever taken, you can tell that they did it with a lot of love \n\nThe place is beautifully decorated not only with chairs but armchairs and a cool couch, they have other drink options ready to go and merchandise such as mugs, hoodies and very nice shirts \n\nVery good sanitation score, good variety on the menu and super attentive, kind and extremely friendly staff \n\nVery very recommended "

Even my niece couldn't help but comment, \"I like her, she's is sweet!\" Her outstanding service elevated our experience.\n\nWe indulged in an array of treats, including the brownie with ice cream, Triple chocolate cake, Chocolate Truffle and Strawberry ice cream cone. Each bite was a symphony of flavors and pure enjoyment. While we didn't have a chance to try the coffee on this visit, the overall quality of the offerings leaves us eagerly anticipating our next visit.\n\nThe combination of exceptional service, delectable treats, and the charming atmosphere at The Percantile and Creamery make it a must-visit."

I wish I would have caught her name but the young lady who helped us delivered premium service! She was so patient and so kind. She allowed me to get my daughter and aunt situated before I went back to choose and pay for my items. She answered every question I had and then some.\n\nWe loved the ice cream! My aunt is an ice cream connoisseur and worked at our local creamery back home for years. She was very impressed!\n\nI brought home a couple apple pie cronuts for my mom and husband and they devoured those as well. My mom said the best part was pulling the flakey layers at each bite!\n\nThis was such a fantastic experience! Percantile and Creamery you have certainly set the bar high for your competitors!"

Make sure to ask for the waffle to be warmed up. Our favorite flavor so far was the White Chocolate Raspberry ice cream. They don't make their own ice cream, but Tillamook is pretty good.\n\nThe service is usually a bit slow, but I don't mind waiting. The only real problem we've had is that the last time we went, we sat outside on their patio (like we had the previous times). They give you a number and bring your order to you. On this occasion, we waited quite a while, so we went inside to check on it.\n\nUpon doing so, they told us they didn't know where we were, so they didn't bring the food. They then handed us a cold waffle with completely melted ice cream. This wasn't ideal to me since we were sitting on their patio, but I guess we'll just wait for our food inside from now on."

The prices were reasonable. The service was attentive. We were satisfied customers and will come back when we pass through Concord in the future."

I notice this the most when I have an iced coffee. But coffee is a personal preference, so I wouldn't have my preference dissuade you from you coming in! Percantile is still one of my go to locations for meeting with friends and getting work done outside of the house because of its atmosphere and abundance of electrical outlets."
