Immediately headed to Flav's for an Italian sandwich. Bread baked on the premises! I love being in the South but I do miss the genuine Italian food that was so plentiful when I lived in the CT-NY-NJ region. I have not had anything that I consider true Italian since leaving Connecticut over 20 years ago (think Bimonte's Pizza, Sally's and Frank Pepe's in New Haven)\n\nI showed them the picture of what brought me there and then picked a non-vegetarian version of the photo I had seen. It has prosciutto, arugula, one or two more meats and shaved Parmesan.  That was all I could hear the shop owner day, I was too busy drooling over what I was about to enjoy. He toasted my sandwich, I grabbed one little pastry and headed home. My sandwich was still warm when I got home and I tore into it, didn't come up for sure until I had eaten almost half of it. Hence, no photo to share.\n\nI will be going back tomorrow for freshly baked sfogliatellas (known as clams to those of us who can't pronounce the word) - he does them only on Thursdays and Saturdays. As satiated as I am after my sandwich, my mouth is watering right now in anticipation of what tomorrow is going to bring. I'm about 13 miles away from Flav's here in Monroe NC, but it is worth the trip and I expect I will be going there many more times to try so many of the other sandwiches I saw on the menu."
