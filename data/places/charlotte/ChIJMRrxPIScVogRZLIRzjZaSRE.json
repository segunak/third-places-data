            "review_text": "Updating my review because the customer service here has gotten worse. This time, the issue was with the manager on duty, Gabriella Gonzales. I ordered coffee \"for here\" in a mug, but she served it in a paper cup instead. When I reminded her about my request, she simply poured the coffee into a mug, compromising its freshness. Additionally, no side chocolate was provided, which is usually standard here.\nI asked for a fresh Americano in a mug, but she refused and argued with me in front of other customers, claiming it was against their policy. When I decided to cancel my orders and requested a refund, she argued again, insisting she could only refund the coffee, not the full order.\nI've visited coffee shops in 36 states and have never experienced service even close like this. I won't be coming back.\n\nThe service gets worse. Seems like they have new inexperienced baristas all the time. Today was the worst. Got to return whatever was prepared as Americano and get my refund.\n\"Three times I visited this coffeeshop. The place itself is good, lots of tables and electrical plugs to work with computers. The service however is inconsistent, One time Americano was great with two side little chocolates, another time it tasted watery. Customer service is not friendly, not sure if they are getting any training to greet customers properly. Restrooms are not taking care, advised them that they are out of towels, no one took care of it. This place could have been great with proper customer service training and consistent coffee quality.\""

The service is a little lacking- the baristas asked multiple times if my items were for here to which I said yes, and all of my items came in to-go containers... the items all took a long time- the sandwich took 20 minutes, the woman who took my order was not attentive/engaged during our interaction. It's a great coffee shop but it seems all of the baristas just could use some service reminders."

This location is our favorite. The helpful employees are friendly and cheerful, especially Amor, Kate and Maurizio. There are plenty of tables inside and out to linger over a cup of amazing coffee or tea, or study, read a good book or catch up with a friend. Highly recommended!"

I ordered avocado toast. Then I was told they have run out of avocados. So I ordered the smoked salmon. And guess what -- I was then told they were out of Salmon too. Why not cross the things off the menu when you're out? Or when you have a chance to tell me that you have no avocados, also tell me that you have no salmon! And how about an apology instead of a blank stare. \"I'm so sorry, but we are out of several things today... Avocados, and salmon\" would sure go along way.\n\n2.  When I completed my order, I was told I should sit down and that they would find me. I thought this meant my food would be delivered. Nope. It means they will call out what you ordered and set it on the bar to get cold. They did not ask my name so they could not call me by name. And I didn't know the menu name of what I had ordered, so I did not recognize that. The place was busy and noisy so I did not hear them call much of anything... My sandwich sat on the bar for a long time before I got so hungry I went looking.\n\nThe big things are done really well at this place. The pastries, sandwiches, and oh my the coffee... All are terrific. Now, if they could just ice the little things -- like customer service -- it would be my favorite place.  I'll add a 5th star when that happens!"

I was skeptical when Waterbean bought it, but thought I would still try it out. They have completely ruined the warmth in this coffee shop while trying to convert it to a \"modern\" coffee shop. It's all white and plain. There's no life to the place anymore. It's boring, bland and cold in its style. When I look for a place to spend time I want somewhere inviting and cozy. This place just no longer has that. The way it was when it was \"Unwind\" was perfect. They captured every aspect of what a coffee shop should be. It's a bummer Waterbean isn't able to hold onto that. On top of that, their coffee is subpar at best and I wish they still had the many tea options as before. It made the place unique. Now it's just another boring chain coffee shop."
