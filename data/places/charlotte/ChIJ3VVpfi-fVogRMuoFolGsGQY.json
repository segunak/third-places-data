Also, there was a bunch of people in their kitchen and they didn't call my number and I was like I think this is my soup and they're like OK you can take it and he stayed texting on his phone, didn't look up don't not have a care in the world lol I was like OK thank you..... and I had to like teach my hand into the kitchen Cubby hole thing he like refused to look up and hand it to me which was awk because there is like a table separating you from there area They normally set the food on the tables that you can grab it and then And put it on the spiky thing, but they told me to put it there and then they told me to reach into their kitchen and grab my own soup. I was like OK lol. It was really awkward. lol good has gone down hill and service is a joke. That sucks I really used to like that place.\n\nEdit\n\nThe actual owner reached out to me when I left a message and corrected the staff and gave me a gift card. He told me that they were transitioning soups and they gave me the last of the soup and they shouldn't have any. He apologized for that as well as correcting his employees.\n\nI really appreciate that because I was there for work and I used a little across the street and I was showing a coworker the spot and it really made me sad how I felt like the place was going downhill, but he assured me that he corrected the situation and he even went as far as to giving me a gift card and apologizing for the nasty soup and that speaks volumes to me and I really appreciate that so I will be visiting again And I am updating this review"

I ordered a breakfast online for a business meeting at 7:30 AM and requested the earliest time which was 9:00 assuming they would prepare it asap. I arrived at 8:15 and they had not started the breakfast so I told them when asked I would keep the order but I requested if they could \"hustle\" since I have a 9:00 scheduled meeting.  I had to bite my tongue when the guy with long hair behind the counter replied \"ain't nobody hustling for you because you ordered this for 9 AM now pay for your order now\"\n\nAs I mentioned after years of spending time and money here, this will be the last time I ever come back to a rhino market bc it took everything in me not to blow up on this guy."

The coffee is the best on the SouthEnd and before this morning I would have said the same about the breakfast sandwiches. However, this morning a series of events showed me that I need to find a different place for food. Firstly, my order was taken by a young woman who obviously wanted to be anywhere else. Secondly, it took almost 9 minutes and 6 people being served their food before me when I had ordered before them. Thirdly, the white of the egg was literally dark brown and  very crispy. Four and final the long haired wanna-be hippie at the register decided I had taken the gross handling of my food personally, like the people in the kitchen were incompetent because it was me... Nope I said \"whoever made this sandwich can have it, because I'm not going to eat it\" He got even more indigent when I showed him and asked if he would want to eat it. HE caused the issue not me, and I even said that I phrased my statement so I would not be labeled as a \"Karen\". Which always is the case when an older white woman voices her dissatisfaction with service. Then he said he'd throw in the trash I said that was fine and he could keep my money.\nI know they don't care that I will never enter this location again, I am but one person, but I've had my say and will be on my way. Wish I had taken a picture of the mess, but he knows what I'm talking about, he saw it. Have a good day hippie man."

I had come in earlier to ask did they have public restrooms because clearly we're still in a pandemic not every store is offering this.

I asked for bag then Got a rude \"alright thank you\" then asked for a receipt \"alright thank you\" dude was a complete ahole for no reason my thing is sir if you dont like your job go get another. I also saw him coming towards the bathroom with his keys the first time i said i was going to the restroom (my guess is he thought I was stealing) when clearly i wasnt even in there bc both were locked he brushed past me I dont get what this guys deal was! Very rude and trust you can tell when someone has an attitude literally watched him check out the white patrons in front of me and he wasnt acting that way! Also in times of covid nobody wants your dirty bare hands all over the top of their drink.... WILL NOT BE COMING HERE AGAIN! Will definitely stick to the one near inner city beside duke energy building!"
