We went on their first day reopening and the line was out the door right at opening. The owner came out to talk to and shake hands with everyone waiting in line to thank them for their support and so many of the people knew him and told him how glad they were to see them back. I recommend trying to be there when it opens so you have the most options available because a lot of things will sell out every quickly."

We came here just for the canele because from what we've seen on the picture, this place by far has the best canele ever in the States.\n\nThe staff was the nicest people ever. Not to mention they're French-African I knew right away it'd be good and it really was.\n\nUnfortunately we didn't take any pictures of the tart we got but it was the nectarine tart and the date mousse cake. When I tell you the dessert were not sweet it is definitely a compliment. They have the right taste to it especially the nectarine one. You'd feel fruity taste in the tart and it's not overwhelmed by the sugar.\n\nFor the canele, they're the right size and the caramel crust they have on it is so perfect. From what I've had over here no other bakeries can bake it the same as they do. No other places can make the crust as crunchy as them. I'm loving every bite I take.\n\nWe'd definitely come back earlier because we were here very late and they ran out of some good pastry and cakes. We'll also try their coffee and chai tea next time!"

We visit France twice a year so we do know what fresh french baguettes and pastries should taste like but unfortunately we didn't find them here.  We arrived when they open at 8:30am but the croissants and baguettes were not yet ready to come out of the oven.  When the baguette was finally ready, it was nice and warm but was not as light and airy in the middle as we expect from a good baguette.  The baguette crust was good but just a bit too dense inside and at $5 for a small baguette, is five times more expensive than what you would get at a French boulangerie.\n\nAlso tried their madelines which were quite tasty with nice crunchy edges and ordered a bacon quiche which was tasty but not exceptional.  Also ordered capuccinos which were good."

When I found Mado bakery  online and look at the pictures, I could already see that everything would taste exactly like the pastries that I'll find in Bordeaux. And I was right, the macaroons are delicious,  the best I have tested in the US and at the same level that the ones I used to eat back home. The choux  pastries are unreal and show to me that the owners have the French savoir faire. If you want real authentic French  << boulangerie >> style pastries then you have to go there only. THE BEST!"

They take the time to explain all the new items, of which there are everytime we go in, and to give recommendations. The menu is so varied each time we go, giving us a new experience each time- and yes there are some staple choices for those who like a little more routine. This place is a little slice of heaven, just like their treats. If you have a super busy lifestyle, or are in the slumps, this is the kind of place you make time for. When I say their coffee is incomparable, I mean it. You will not find another cafe nor a bakery of this quality anywhere near this area. If I could give 10 stars, I would."
