                "review_text": "My first experience at Rally was as a volunteer for the Coffee Club which is a non-profit that helps feed the unhoused of Charlotte. Rally gave a space to this organization to create snack bags and make sandwiches for the unhoused. This was the beginning of my curiosity of the game of pickleball and this place called, Rally.\n\nSeveral months later, I signed up for a Rookies course to learn the game of pickleball. The instructor, Rosie, was immediately welcoming when I showed up. As an introvert, I needed this warm welcome to feel comfortable. The course was fantastic and after an hour of learning how to \"dink\" and find out what a \"kitchen\"  was I was hooked and an hour became too short.\n\nWith each weekly class, I made friends, learned more pickleball lingo, upskilled, and felt so comfortable playing pickleball I found myself staying afterwards to watch others play and signed up for socials, shuffles, courts and coffee and other events. The staff was welcoming, remembered my name and encouraged this learning journey.\n\nStack all of that with a delicious menu, from a delicious wood-fire pizza, caesar salad with chicken skewers, protein shakes, burgers, tacos...I've nearly tried it all...this place has all the stars from me. OH and wonderful cocktails.\n\nIt's for all these reasons (and many more) Rally has easily become my \"third place\" - my Central Perk, Cheers, MacLaren's, Paddy's Pub...and I would highly recommend you check out this place. Whether you are looking for a pickleball spot that's a little more social then other spots; a good bite to eat; some great people watching over a drink or a nice breakfast spot to catch up with a friend or have your next \"out of office\" work chat...I would check out Rally.",

Rally gave a space to this organization to create snack bags and make sandwiches for the unhoused. This was the beginning of my curiosity of the game of pickleball and this place called, Rally.\n\nSeveral months later, I signed up for a Rookies course to learn the game of pickleball. The instructor, Rosie, was immediately welcoming when I showed up. As an introvert, I needed this warm welcome to feel comfortable. The course was fantastic and after an hour of learning how to \"dink\" and find out what a \"kitchen\"  was I was hooked and an hour became too short.\n\nWith each weekly class, I made friends, learned more pickleball lingo, upskilled, and felt so comfortable playing pickleball I found myself staying afterwards to watch others play and signed up for socials, shuffles, courts and coffee and other events. The staff was welcoming, remembered my name and encouraged this learning journey.\n\nStack all of that with a delicious menu, from a delicious wood-fire pizza, caesar salad with chicken skewers, protein shakes, burgers, tacos...I've nearly tried it all...this place has all the stars from me. OH and wonderful cocktails.\n\nIt's for all these reasons (and many more) Rally has easily become my \"third place\" - my Central Perk, Cheers, MacLaren's, Paddy's Pub...and I would highly recommend you check out this place. Whether you are looking for a pickleball spot that's a little more social then other spots; a good bite to eat; some great people watching over a drink or a nice breakfast spot to catch up with a friend or have your next \"out of office\" work chat...I would check out Rally.",
