One of my favorite things about this place is the passion that the owner has for clean food and how joyful she is in sharing it with others. Coffee is one of the food items that is most heavily processed and traditionally produced coffee can retain toxins. I've had some of their baked goods in the past and they are wonderful also.\n\nStopping for coffee is a guilty pleasure of mine, but there is no need for guilt here - it's all good clean enjoyment.\n\nThe atmosphere is modern and welcoming. It would be a more fun place to meet friends if there were some comfy squishy chairs.\n\nI will be back and bring my friends!"

They serve crepes as well and gave away one of their homemade granola bars for free. Take note that there is not a large seating area so you might want to go there early or at an off hour if you prefer to sit while you drink. There is also minimal parking if the connected businesses are busy. The only negative is I would not recommend having an important meeting or consultation here due to lack of privacy and the ease of hearing other's conversations."

The Raw Crunch bars have everything your body loves and nothing your mouth struggles to pronounce (if you get my meaning). All healthy options and sooo tasty! They also offer breakfast crepes for many of you on the go. This place is a vibe! You have to check it out. Enjoy!"
