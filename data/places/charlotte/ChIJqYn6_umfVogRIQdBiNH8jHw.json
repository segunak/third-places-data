            "review_text": "The place is a cool concept, but could really be cleaned up a bit. I feel that management is inexperienced in running a business like this. They do not seem to see the bigger picture, in way that could increase their over all profits in the long run.\n\nFor example, they have wifi that does not really work anywhere in the store. The store looks like it may have been built prior to the internet's existence, if not during it.\nThere are people that would utilize the tables and patio for group meetings, in which they could offer the store money just to rent the space, but also the individual attendees would then spend money while there, thus increasing the store's overall profits.\nThey seem too cheap to hire a wi-fi specialist to come and fix their wi-fi system, failing to see the bigger picture.\n\nThey seem more interested in gaining upon their well-placed location alone. They are surrounded by middle class and upper-middle class families that likely enjoy shopping there due to the convenience of location.\nBUT, because the internet (something they seem willfully ignorant of lol...) is taking over the market, in the next decade or so, as stores like Amazon and Walmart increase the abilities of their delivery services, and accomplish things that Webvan failed to back in the early 2000's, local stores will not be able to compete with the competitive marketplace prices; as wholesale stores will continue to build factories and warehouses closer to suburbs, which will push older business models like this Harris Teeters out of the neighborhood.\nIn fact, I would wager that this Harris Teeters grocery store is planning to close, which is why they are cutting corners and pinching pennies, instead of finding innovative ways to stay in business and increase their overall financial gains. They will probably sell the location to Walmart or some commercial real estate company within the next 10 years. Sad, because they have so much potential to evolve with the spirit of the times.\n\nThey have a wine and beer bar upstairs, and allow musicians to play there. I think they only allow this once a week on a Thursday though. Why? If you have multiple open mic nights and support the local arts, you will not only enrich the entire local community and earn their respect and admiration, but again; you would increase your overall profit. Make the local people happy, and they will want to continue supporting you. Exceed their current expectations and blow them away, then you will have people traveling from neighboring communities to see what this store is all about; which would again, increase your profit...\n\nA lot of things in the store are outdated and need to be replaced. There are actual safety hazards. The other day I walked outside onto the patio upstairs to see what it was like, and realize that the concrete patio stone tiles were not fully supported underneath.\nThey have rather large circular-shaped holes underneath them, only offering partial support to the tiles. I noticed this because I saw one of the tiles broken in half. I was surprised and felt unsafe, so I made my way back inside. On my way back inside, I lost my balance and nearly fell over because one of the concrete patio stone tiles was not fully supported, and it \"teetered\" (lol... guess I understand the store name now), causing me to almost fall. Very unsafe, and poorly regulated construction.\n\nThe reason I am giving the store 1-star, is not because of just the above mentioned things, but mostly because management and whoever owns the store, really does not seem to care at all about their customers, but only means to milk the local community of their hard-earned money, based solely on the advantage of the store's location. I have met many cool, honest, hard-working staff here, who were just wonderful people. Sadly, most of them are not management. A couple of the managers there are good people, whereas the majority of them are in it purely for the money and do not seem to really like their jobs. If they do not like their jobs, then find someone who would! Anyways..."

I could be pulling out a bag of spinach from the cooler and someone comes right in front of me to load the shelves as if they didn't see me. It feels a little like I'm bothering or annoying the staff just by grocery shopping in a grocery store. Definitely a pretentious vibe, but I guess it is Myers Park."

A few girlfriends and I came to grab some food and saw a woman struggling to pay for her items (she was short 5$). When a friend of mine offered to pay, shortly after a couple of employees offered to make up the difference, my friend was told no she could not and turned away. I then asked to speak to management on why one customer was not allowed to help another and she said that there were too many people like her coming in and out of there begging. First of all, this woman was not begging nor was she being spiteful to the employees. I will not be coming back to this Harris teeter and I hope to see some changes in the heart of this place. At a time like this in the world, we should be more compassionate to those who need us."

This store has a much larger wine selection than most stores. I feel most stores focus on a mix of beer and wine, while this store actually advertises its wine selection and has outdoor seating overlooking the Queens/Providence intersection. Parking is limited, in a more car centric part of the city this might be an issue, but I've only been a few times. Just look out for Range Rovers hogging the compact spaces."

I went in and bought a refill card on the way to work only to realize I bought Verizon's and not T mobiles. So I went right back and explained my mistake and they refused to help me at all. They would not return it or exchange it for what I needed. Even after I explained it was a simple mistake that I literaly just made 5 minutes ago. I explained I just had 1000 dollars stolen from me and I couldnt afford to get my phone turned back on if they couldnt help me. They absolutely refused. And in this covid-19 crisis this is how Heris Teeter shows their southern hospitality. By stealing your money and having no heart. Absolutely terrible. Im shopping anywhere else but here."
