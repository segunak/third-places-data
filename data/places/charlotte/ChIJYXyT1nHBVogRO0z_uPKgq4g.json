When I walked into Alchemy, the young Barista was working on a couple orders that were apparently placed via phone/internet.  She looked at me and politely said she would be with me in a moment.  Before I could place my order, two ladies walked in, appeared to be regulars by the conversation with the Barista, and the young lady just ignored me standing there and went straight for one of the ladies order.  I just stood there, but when she started taking the second lady's order without saying a word to me, I turned around and left.  Everything looked really good but unfortunately I can't comment on how good it really was as I never got to place my order.  Maybe it's just not my morning."

            "review_text": "Absolutely fantastic service and coffee. My husband and I have been looking for a good remote-work-spot coffee shop in the area and this one is AMAZING. I almost hate leaving a review because I don't want this gem taken by other WFH people! But I have to. They're worth it. They deserve every penny they get from the community.\n\nPrices:\nReasonable/Low considering the area and specialty coffee prices. I was very pleased with this. Husband and I both got 16oz (medium) coffees. Him basic. Me specialty. The total was $10.\n\nCoffee:\nBasic Hot Vanilla Latte: Goodness gracious, the best vanilla latte I've ever tasted and of course it was my husband's drink, not mine, so I only got a few sips but there was an exquisite blend of smooth, creamy vanilla infused with rich espresso, creating a symphony of flavors that dance on my taste buds. Each sip was like a warm embrace, indulging my senses with the perfect balance of sweetness and depth. It left me craving more...but luckily I had my own coffee.\n\nSpeciality The Wanderer - Off Road Experience: I was thoroughly impressed by this coffee's rich, deep, and sweet flavor profile. It's like embarking on a journey through a flavorful landscape with every sip. The unique combination of boldness and sweetness makes it a standout choice for anyone seeking a truly indulgent coffee experience. I highly recommend it to fellow sweet lovers looking to explore new depths of flavor.\nWarning, this coffee was sweeter than I was expecting. That's GREAT for someone like me who really enjoys sweet coffee (it was not too sweet for me), but I know many coffee enthusiasts who might be turned off by this. I'll definitely be ordering this again.\n\nService:\nI was blown away by the exceptional service I received from the two women at the counter. Their warmth, efficiency, and attentiveness made my experience truly memorable. Their positive attitude and friendliness truly sets this coffee shop apart. We struck up conversation about life and coffee because I'm a chatty lady, but they were super respectful and not pushy to talk to someone that seemed not so chatty (like my husband ^_^) I'll definitely be returning, thanks to their outstanding service!\n\nAtmosphere - Remote Work Compatibility\nI was worried about this because I know it's in a remote working building, so I didn't know if there would be any free seating, but surprisingly, there is! There's a bar with about 5-6 seats down near the front counter (I didn't try these seats), and then with a short walk up a ramp behind the counter there is free seating in a  small loft area. There were 3 - 4 high tables with bar chairs and about 6 - 8 comfy armchairs seated in a circle in the center of the seating section in the loft. I'm a very chunky and short woman myself and find bar chairs very uncomfortable, generally speaking. However, these bar chairs were surprisingly comfortable, wide, and sturdy! Plenty of back support. My legs dangled, but that's expected. I could've worked there for a couple hours without getting uncomfortable. I didn't try the leather armchairs but they looked comfy and nice.\n\nI am SO thankful that this place had free seating! I will definitely be setting up remote-shop in the future if the spots don't all get taken by the inevitable influx of WFH people who discover this place! Sometimes you just need a change of scenery!"
