This leaves their business not easily accessible to people with disabilities and completely inaccessible to young people without cards, a lot of homeless community members & lower income individuals. Of course there is a wheelchair accessible entrance due to ADA laws but you have to enter the building NJC is attached to through heavy double doors with no power open option and take an extremely inconvenient route that is not an option for people with different abilities without some help. I left 2 stars simply because the coffee was good, but customer service and the not so welcoming atmosphere will have me unlikely to return."

He insisted on redoing it for me. So he re-did it while walking the girl through every step. His desire for high quality was so admirable and I loved how he graciously trained the girl that is still learning. Love small businesses like this!! My husband with very high standards (regarding coffee) said \"best pour over I ever had.\" Highly recommend!!!"

People smiled when I ordered, but didn't really make conversation. The atmosphere was boring and bland with super uncomfortable chairs and high tables. This is not a place to hangout and relax while drinking your coffee. I should have gotten my coffee to go. Not a place I would go out of my way to repeat."
