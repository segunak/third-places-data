The decor had intricate details that truly reflected Yemen and with the arabic music playing in the background, it truly felt like you were transported there.\n\nWe tried the pistachio latte, Qamaria latte, pistachio milk cake, kunafe cup, and bee bites. I really liked the Qamaria latte- perfectly balanced with just the right touch of cardamom. My husband usually doesn\u2019t like sweets, but he finished the entire slice of bee bite- which is a big deal.. lol. The pistachio milk cake was okayish, and the kunafe cup wasn\u2019t as good as I expected. The menu overall felt a little limited, I wish they had included some savory options. But since it was their very first day, I believe they kept things simple for the launch and may expand it later.\n\nEven though it didn\u2019t fully match my expectations, I\u2019d still say it was definitely worth the visit.",

From the moment you walk in, the warm hospitality and rich aroma of spices set the tone for something special. If you\u2019re tired of the same old coffee chains, this place is a breath of fresh air.\nI ordered the Yemeni adeni tea and it was incredible beautifully balanced with spices like cardamom. just sweet enough without being overpowering. It\u2019s smooth, fragrant, and unlike anything you\u2019ll find at a typical coffee shop. It\u2019s the kind of drink you sip slowly because you don\u2019t want it to end.\nThe appetizers wow specially the bint alsahn (Yemeni honey butter bread) is delicious, fresh, and clearly made with care. Perfectly flaky, warm, and paired so well with the adni tea and goes with any other hot drinks.\nThe space itself is clean, welcoming, and full of cultural touches that make it feel authentic yet comfortable. Staff were kind, knowledgeable, and happy to show u and serve u. if you\u2019re unfamiliar with Yemeni coffee traditions.\nHighly recommend Qamaria for anyone looking to expand their coffee horizons. Whether you\u2019re a casual coffee drinker, tea drinker or a full on enthusiast, this place is worth the trip.",

The decor had intricate details that truly reflected Yemen and with the arabic music playing in the background, it truly felt like you were transported there.\n\nWe tried the pistachio latte, Qamaria latte, pistachio milk cake, kunafe cup, and bee bites. I really liked the Qamaria latte- perfectly balanced with just the right touch of cardamom. My husband usually doesn\u2019t like sweets, but he finished the entire slice of bee bite- which is a big deal.. lol. The pistachio milk cake was okayish, and the kunafe cup wasn\u2019t as good as I expected. The menu overall felt a little limited, I wish they had included some savory options. But since it was their very first day, I believe they kept things simple for the launch and may expand it later.\n\nEven though it didn\u2019t fully match my expectations, I\u2019d still say it was definitely worth the visit.",

From the moment you walk in, the warm hospitality and rich aroma of spices set the tone for something special. If you\u2019re tired of the same old coffee chains, this place is a breath of fresh air.\nI ordered the Yemeni adeni tea and it was incredible beautifully balanced with spices like cardamom. just sweet enough without being overpowering. It\u2019s smooth, fragrant, and unlike anything you\u2019ll find at a typical coffee shop. It\u2019s the kind of drink you sip slowly because you don\u2019t want it to end.\nThe appetizers wow specially the bint alsahn (Yemeni honey butter bread) is delicious, fresh, and clearly made with care. Perfectly flaky, warm, and paired so well with the adni tea and goes with any other hot drinks.\nThe space itself is clean, welcoming, and full of cultural touches that make it feel authentic yet comfortable. Staff were kind, knowledgeable, and happy to show u and serve u. if you\u2019re unfamiliar with Yemeni coffee traditions.\nHighly recommend Qamaria for anyone looking to expand their coffee horizons. Whether you\u2019re a casual coffee drinker, tea drinker or a full on enthusiast, this place is worth the trip.",
