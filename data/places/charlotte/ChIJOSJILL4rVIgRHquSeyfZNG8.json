Kindness and respect are very important to us.\n\nStory: My wife and I went here for brunch and everyone was kind and the place looked nice.  Before ordering I asked the kind gentleman up front what sausage they use in the burrito and he said it\u2019s a breakfast-sausage patty that they cut up.  Well when we got the food it was ground Italian sausage because I can taste the overwhelming fennel in it.  My wife took the plate back up and VERY kindly asked for another burrito that has bacon because I really dislike this sausage. The OWNERS reply to her employee was \u201cshe can pay for another one\u2026!\u201d. I confronted the owner (which I was visibly frustrated at this point because my wife is the sweetest person I know) and told her this is not what your employee told me and not to get an attitude with us since your employee told me something different.  We then had a disagreement on what is considered \u201cbreakfast\u201d sausage which I understand, but there was absolutely no compromise and she refused to remake or offer any alternatives.

The pork sausage we use is called \"Breakfast Sausage\" by the manufacturer and it is the same sausage we have used since we purchased the business over 3.5 years ago. We also offer chicken sausage and Kielbasa sausage should you not want the pork breakfast sausage. We offered to make you another burrito if you wished to purchase an additional one because the issue was you did not like the flavor of the pork breakfast sausage. We also offered to wrap up the original burrito for you to take home/share with another person since you paid for the order. You did not want to take no for an answer so you proceeded to argue across the line with not only myself but our cooking staff as well. Just because you did not prefer the flavor does not mean we have to make something different for you at no cost. This is why the menu has this policy. Sometimes, the answer is no. Sometimes, when eating at a restaurant,  you decide for future reference not to order a particular dish because it is not something you prefer in taste. We wish you well.",

He asked several times to make sure it was breakfast sausage and not Italian sausage that goes on pizza. When his food arrived, it was Italian sausage. I kindly brought the food to up to the front and asked for bacon instead. The owner, female, who was working in the kitchen, told the cashier in a very loud and rude tone that I would just have to pay for a new one! My husband approached her afterward and explained the situation, and she was incredibly hateful and unprofessional to us. She said we could have a box for the sausage burrito he couldn\u2019t eat\u2026\nHer attitude was quite literally disgusting and it was the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had in a restaurant. Me and my husband both worked in food service for several years, and we were both astounded. I will never go back there, and I\u2019ll be sure to relay the message to everyone I know.",

Depending upon what protein you choose, and if you add any extras, the burrito can range in price starting at $9.50. Our side order of grits is $2.50 - so I am not understanding where you got $10. Are you referring to our Home style Grit Bowl that has grits plus potatoes, cheese, a protein, and an egg? We are pleased you enjoyed the food and coffees you received. Our staff works hard to provide fresh, quality food to our guests. We feature may local vendors from the Southeast region who specialize in pastries, hot sauces, BBQ sauces, and other tasty items to snack on.\nThank you again for the feedback - we appreciate you and hope to see you again soon!",

                "review_text": "We have enjoyed Provisions as a breakfast/brunch spot for years.  Whenever we have friends visit from out of the area, we want to show off our downtown area and with that, comes a trip to Provisions.  Nobody is ever disappointed.\n\nOur most recent trip downtown came at the request of our 13 year old kid. Our kid was excited to order the breakfast burrito. But that wasn't enough, as they also ordered a blueberry pancake too. Our kid is a pescatarian and the kitchen staff was able to accommodate and make the burrito meat-free. We had a happy and satisfied teenager.\n\nMy wife and I each ordered the same thing, the scrambler.  I had mine with bacon and my wife's had kielbasa.  Since it was a weekend, biscuits were available, so that's what I got on the side. The scrambler is an ideal brunch. It's stuffed with veggies to make it feel healthyish and the eggs give you plenty of protein. Cooked perfectly and seasoned well, it's a filling breakfast for sure. The biscuits have a unique flavor to them with cracked pepper sprinkled on top. They aren't my favorite biscuit, but they are enjoyable enough that I get one any time it's offered here.  As for the kielbasa, it was fine, but tasted more like smoked sausage than a traditional eastern European kielbasa (which is what I was expecting based on the name). We won't order that again, but I also helped my wife finish it and we didn't have leftovers.\n\nIn the past we have tried the chicken salad (had a weird taste), yogurt bowls (amazing), oatmeal (also amazing), veggie panini (my wife likes it), Greek salad (so-so produce and the dressing was just okay) and tomato soup (too sweet for our kid). The general consensus from our family is that they do breakfast great and other foods just okay. We sometimes try something, and whether or not we love it, we keep coming back knowing the next meal will make us happy.\n\nWe also love the unique store to peruse and shop in while waiting for our meal. Lots of fun and quirky local items from cooking ingredients to towels to alpaca socks.\n\nOverall, we highly recommend Provisions, especially for breakfast. Come visit downtown Waxhaw, enjoy a morning meal here, then wander the area enjoying the sights and sounds of the area.",

Owner was SO nice and said of course you can, explained how ordering/ seating works and even directed us to a table with an outlet to charge devices. Food was very reasonably priced and really good. Potatoes and bacon were well seasoned, biscuits were fluffy and hot, pancake was so good I ordered a second when I was done. The server and other staff were also really sweet and kind. I will be back often for good food with very friendly service. I love that they serve breakfast so late in the day too!",

I checked the system and see the order was opened at 12:39pm and paid for at 12:44pm - since you were in the building I am not sure why there was a delay between ordering and payment - did you walked away from the register before the transaction was completed? All orders are made to order and it can take up to 15 minutes depending on the flow of business. Yes we do accept call in orders and we let our customers know at that time how long it will be. I will follow up with the ladies who assisted you to find out where the disconnect happened between ordering and paying. We do hope this will not deter you from visiting us again in the future.

It appears that you got our grit bowl - $8.50 - and depending upon the type of coffee - $3-$5.50 - is the range for our coffee drinks which has pricing set based upon current market trends. I wish you would have spoken with us at the time of your visit as we could have corrected any issues you had at the time. We do hope you will give us another try - possibly try one of our other many food options. Thank you and hope your Holiday week is a good one.",

We arrived fairly early on a Saturday, around 8:30, and it wasn\u2019t too busy.  You place your order at the counter and then take your table marker (a seed packet) to your desired seat. The person who took our order was very friendly. We had the breakfast burrito with bacon and the Papa\u2019s Breakfast - pork sausage patty, two eggs scrambled with fried potatoes, and a croissant for the bread choice. For drinks we had a regular Latte and a Brown Sugar Latte. Everything was ready fairly quickly. The lattes were excellent and I especially enjoyed the Brown Sugar Latte - I would definitely stop in for that again if nearby. The Breakfast Burrito was good, however I felt it was overfilled with potato and I ended up removing half of the potato filling. Unfortunately, the other breakfast was fairly cold, and the fried potatoes were extremely over-seasoned. The croissant was the best part of that breakfast option. Overall, would probably not try  breakfast here again, but would have a latte.",

I could not see/taste any) -For $9 that is VERY disappointing & how can you even mess up flavoring eggs, potatoes, and sausage??? The salsa even tasted like/probably is store bought jarred stuff since it tastes exactly like Tostitos Salsa. Also, broccoli cheddar soup wasn't hot AT ALL and wasn't that flavorful either, not even creamy, more watery than anything else. It's so bad that I didn't even finish my food. Took a few bites of the turkey panini and to no surprise that was bland as well and the bread wasn't even crunchy it was super soft still. $28 spent (bf had pancakes which he is leaving his own review on that) for garbage. Definitely NOT a returning customer. People work hard for their money and hope to spend it on quality products, SO, PLEASE, DO BETTER.\n\nP.s.

It was my moms birthday and she had a rough couple of days and we wanted to take her for a nice breakfast. Unfortunately, reservations are not available, so she recommended giving a call right before coming in. I had asked if I could bring candles to put in a desert breakfast, and the young lady told me they could provide candles and was very accommodating. When I called back, a gentleman answered the phone and was extremely short with and rude to me. He stated that he did not know if they even had candles and couldn\u2019t get off the phone fast enough. I figured I was speaking to a new employee with little knowledge and asked if it would be easier to ask the manager. The gentleman replied, stating he was the owner! I was shocked. I am so grateful we took our business elsewhere, where we received great service and were able to give my mom a wonderful birthday breakfast with her grandsons! I would definitely recommend NOT going here.",

Our veggie wrap has mixed greens, hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, and Greek dressing inside. I wish you would have let our staff know at the time there was a problem and they could have fixed it at that time. If you would like to speak to us directly, please contact us at provisionswxw@yahoo.com and we will get back to you.

We do offer gluten free items in our shop including some pastries however we no longer have a gluten free bread offered on the menu because the vendor we had been using went out of business late 2021. It is not that we wanted to stop carrying their bread for our gluten free customers we did not have a choice in the matter. If we do find a comparable gluten free bread that will hold up to the various sandwiches in our kitchen we will be more than happy to offer that. We have just not found one that is comporable. If there was an issue with your salad I wish you would have spoken with us at the time of your visit and we would have corrected any issues at that time. It concerns us that you felt out staff was rude. If you would email us at provisionswxw@yahoo.com and give us more information on that aspect we would love to further investigate what happened. I do hope you will return in the future and give us another try. Thank you again for your feedback.",

I apologize that your eggs were not cooked the way you had wanted them to be cooked. When the young man brought your plate back to the kitchen, we had asked him to verify if you wanted them runny or not so we could cook them the way you would liked to have them. He returned to us stating you did not want them runny - so I recooked them over hard for you. We are in the process of training our younger staff on how to handle situations like these in a more professional manner - unfortunately, in this situation, we failed to handle it in a manner to which we did not come across as rude. I do hope you will return and give us another chance - we have a young staff who are learning and we do make mistakes. Please accept this apology and again, we do thank you for taking the time to reach out to us.

Because it is new, we are telling all customers who call in orders that we have that service now. We agree that the online option is not one a person driving should use. Please feel free to call and place an order over the phone if that is more convenient for you to do so - we take several of these types of orders each day.

It's in a restored storefront, half sit down dining room (finished in casual kitchen) with beautiful broad beam flooring, painted wainscot ceiling and enormous glass windows looking to the busy sidewalk...and half vintage hardware store shelving filled with specialty coffees, teas, jams, preserves and much more.  The menu is appealing and our french toast breakfast sandwiches two thick, perfect slices holding egg, cheese, smoky bacon and a perfect complement of a mildly peppery chipotle were done with top shelf ingredients, carefully prepared and were worth a return trip.  The vibe is comfortable, laid back, quality driven at reasonable prices.",

Inside is also a small cafe with a great sandwich menu.  Pricing was reasonable and portion sizes were good and taste was really good.\n\nIf passing through town or nearby, I'd definitely recommend stopping by to eat lunch and check this place out.",

We as a small business appreciate any and all feedback to continually try and make our company better.  We apologize for the long wait time,  but do not apologize for informing you.  Many of our customers come to us during  their lunch break and have limited amount of time. Being that we are NOT a fast food restaurant,  we like to inform our customers when wait times are longer than usual.  We take into account the call in orders that are continually coming in, the line of customers and any delays in meal prep as best as possible.  We are limited in our seating capacity  (because of covid) as well as the speed in which we are able to prepare the fresh, quality food we are known for.  I don't know if the person ahead of you was picking up a previously called in order,  ordering coffee or purchasing market items,  but I certainly didn't mean to single you out as you insinuated to make you feel as though we don't want your patronage.  We appreciate you and every person who walks through our doors and we hope to see you again.  If you care to discuss anything at all with me,  here is my personal cell phone number: 818 434 9093, Ms Lisa.",

One thing that was a little frustrating for us was the flow of ordering and waiting around to get an open seat. We were in the store portion but didn\u2019t want to wait outside and miss getting called for our table. So we were inside and constantly having to move around and out of the way with the amount of people coming in and also ordering (not to mention servers running back and forth to the kitchen). Was a little tedious. I\u2019m sure this is all due to COVID and also us coming in for breakfast on the weekend. I would constructively recommend a conventional method of issuing pagers or collecting phone numbers and calling people back to the restaurant so they don\u2019t have to crowd the store. Hope that\u2019s helpful!",

However, this was not clear if it was for dining in  or getting something from storefront. A woman, who was waiting on people seated outside, walked by my wife. My wife asked her if they were seating people. After acting a little inconvenienced that she had to walk around my wife she says curtly, \" yes we're seating, but there's no available tables,\" and walked off leaving it at that. -- Thanks a lot for your \"courtesy\" and good luck with your business. I would suggest a better way of dealing with potential customers would be saying, \" yes, but I'm sorry there's no availability at the moment, if you would like to wait we would be glad to have you\" or something to that effect.

They offer a variety of delicious menu options, from quiche and other scrumptious breakfast goodies to cold or toasted sandwiches and soups. It doesn't hurt that they make the very BEST Reuben in town! Even though all their sandwiches as terrific, I'm very loyal to their homemade soups. My favorite is the tomato basil.\nI love the atmosphere that Provisions offers. After you place your order at the counter you have time to peruse the shelves that are stocked with local goodies!\nIf you haven't been fortunate enough to eat here put it on your TO DO LIST and stop in real soon!\n(if this review helped give it a \ud83d\udc4d)",

If it tells you anything, I drove 45 min out of the way and pushed a meeting back JUST so I could have breakfast here. The funfetti pancakes will ruin your world. Light, fluffy, not overly sweet and the fetti gives it a little sweet crunch. The eggs, VERY fresh, fluffy and scrambled perfectly with cheese. Lastly, the bacon...........just, just.....phenomenal. I have traveled all over the country, eaten breakfast at a lot of places and can honestly say, easily top 3, maybe even #1 breakfast spot I\u2019ve ever been.\n\nMake it a point to try this place, you will not be disappointed.

Kindness and respect are very important to us.\n\nStory: My wife and I went here for brunch and everyone was kind and the place looked nice.  Before ordering I asked the kind gentleman up front what sausage they use in the burrito and he said it\u2019s a breakfast-sausage patty that they cut up.  Well when we got the food it was ground Italian sausage because I can taste the overwhelming fennel in it.  My wife took the plate back up and VERY kindly asked for another burrito that has bacon because I really dislike this sausage. The OWNERS reply to her employee was \u201cshe can pay for another one\u2026!\u201d. I confronted the owner (which I was visibly frustrated at this point because my wife is the sweetest person I know) and told her this is not what your employee told me and not to get an attitude with us since your employee told me something different.  We then had a disagreement on what is considered \u201cbreakfast\u201d sausage which I understand, but there was absolutely no compromise and she refused to remake or offer any alternatives. So we left.",

We also verify all orders prior to completing the purchase to ensure customers get what they ordered/paid for. The pork sausage we use is called \"Breakfast Sausage\" by the manufacturer and it is the same sausage we have used since we purchased the business over 3.5 years ago. We also offer chicken sausage and Kielbasa sausage should you not want the pork breakfast sausage. We offered to make you another burrito if you wished to purchase an additional one because the issue was you did not like the flavor of the pork breakfast sausage. We also offered to wrap up the original burrito for you to take home/share with another person since you paid for the order. You did not want to take no for an answer so you proceeded to argue across the line with not only myself but our cooking staff as well. Just because you did not prefer the flavor does not mean we have to make something different for you at no cost. This is why the menu has this policy. Sometimes, the answer is no. Sometimes, when eating at a restaurant,  you decide for future reference not to order a particular dish because it is not something you prefer in taste. We wish you well.",

She said we could have a box for the sausage burrito he couldn\u2019t eat\u2026\nHer attitude was quite literally disgusting and it was the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had in a restaurant.

Depending upon what protein you choose, and if you add any extras, the burrito can range in price starting at $9.50. Our side order of grits is $2.50 - so I am not understanding where you got $10. Are you referring to our Home style Grit Bowl that has grits plus potatoes, cheese, a protein, and an egg? We are pleased you enjoyed the food and coffees you received. Our staff works hard to provide fresh, quality food to our guests. We feature may local vendors from the Southeast region who specialize in pastries, hot sauces, BBQ sauces, and other tasty items to snack on.\nThank you again for the feedback - we appreciate you and hope to see you again soon!",

Whenever we have friends visit from out of the area, we want to show off our downtown area and with that, comes a trip to Provisions.  Nobody is ever disappointed.\n\nOur most recent trip downtown came at the request of our 13 year old kid. Our kid was excited to order the breakfast burrito. But that wasn't enough, as they also ordered a blueberry pancake too. Our kid is a pescatarian and the kitchen staff was able to accommodate and make the burrito meat-free. We had a happy and satisfied teenager.\n\nMy wife and I each ordered the same thing, the scrambler.  I had mine with bacon and my wife's had kielbasa.  Since it was a weekend, biscuits were available, so that's what I got on the side. The scrambler is an ideal brunch. It's stuffed with veggies to make it feel healthyish and the eggs give you plenty of protein. Cooked perfectly and seasoned well, it's a filling breakfast for sure. The biscuits have a unique flavor to them with cracked pepper sprinkled on top. They aren't my favorite biscuit, but they are enjoyable enough that I get one any time it's offered here.  As for the kielbasa, it was fine, but tasted more like smoked sausage than a traditional eastern European kielbasa (which is what I was expecting based on the name). We won't order that again, but I also helped my wife finish it and we didn't have leftovers.\n\nIn the past we have tried the chicken salad (had a weird taste), yogurt bowls (amazing), oatmeal (also amazing), veggie panini (my wife likes it), Greek salad (so-so produce and the dressing was just okay) and tomato soup (too sweet for our kid). The general consensus from our family is that they do breakfast great and other foods just okay. We sometimes try something, and whether or not we love it, we keep coming back knowing the next meal will make us happy.\n\nWe also love the unique store to peruse and shop in while waiting for our meal. Lots of fun and quirky local items from cooking ingredients to towels to alpaca socks.\n\nOverall, we highly recommend Provisions, especially for breakfast. Come visit downtown Waxhaw, enjoy a morning meal here, then wander the area enjoying the sights and sounds of the area.",

We love to hear that we can accommodate your family's food needs/preferences. What I love to hear is that even if there is an item that is not what you were expecting, you still come back and know that there are many other options to try on our menu. We look forward to serving you and your family again soon. We do understand the parallel parking out front can be tricky at certain days/times but you are correct, there are plenty of other spots available all around town. Our staff works hard to please our customers and it seems they have done so with you - thank you again for the comments. See you all again soon!",

Owner was SO nice and said of course you can, explained how ordering/ seating works and even directed us to a table with an outlet to charge devices. Food was very reasonably priced and really good. Potatoes and bacon were well seasoned, biscuits were fluffy and hot, pancake was so good I ordered a second when I was done. The server and other staff were also really sweet and kind. I will be back often for good food with very friendly service. I love that they serve breakfast so late in the day too!",

I checked the system and see the order was opened at 12:39pm and paid for at 12:44pm - since you were in the building I am not sure why there was a delay between ordering and payment - did you walked away from the register before the transaction was completed? All orders are made to order and it can take up to 15 minutes depending on the flow of business. Yes we do accept call in orders and we let our customers know at that time how long it will be. I will follow up with the ladies who assisted you to find out where the disconnect happened between ordering and paying. We do hope this will not deter you from visiting us again in the future.

We arrived fairly early on a Saturday, around 8:30, and it wasn\u2019t too busy.  You place your order at the counter and then take your table marker (a seed packet) to your desired seat. The person who took our order was very friendly. We had the breakfast burrito with bacon and the Papa\u2019s Breakfast - pork sausage patty, two eggs scrambled with fried potatoes, and a croissant for the bread choice. For drinks we had a regular Latte and a Brown Sugar Latte. Everything was ready fairly quickly. The lattes were excellent and I especially enjoyed the Brown Sugar Latte - I would definitely stop in for that again if nearby. The Breakfast Burrito was good, however I felt it was overfilled with potato and I ended up removing half of the potato filling. Unfortunately, the other breakfast was fairly cold, and the fried potatoes were extremely over-seasoned. The croissant was the best part of that breakfast option. Overall, would probably not try  breakfast here again, but would have a latte.",

I know they wanted to turn the tables but they were clearing dishes before everyone was through eating and we hadn't been there long. If I was only getting breakfast in Waxhaw once I would recommend Stacks which is on the Weddington side of Waxhaw. I must say that the young lady who took our order before we were seated was excellent. She was friendly and precise.",

I could not see/taste any) -For $9 that is VERY disappointing & how can you even mess up flavoring eggs, potatoes, and sausage??? The salsa even tasted like/probably is store bought jarred stuff since it tastes exactly like Tostitos Salsa. Also, broccoli cheddar soup wasn't hot AT ALL and wasn't that flavorful either, not even creamy, more watery than anything else. It's so bad that I didn't even finish my food. Took a few bites of the turkey panini and to no surprise that was bland as well and the bread wasn't even crunchy it was super soft still. $28 spent (bf had pancakes which he is leaving his own review on that) for garbage. Definitely NOT a returning customer. People work hard for their money and hope to spend it on quality products, SO, PLEASE, DO BETTER.\n\nP.s.

It was my moms birthday and she had a rough couple of days and we wanted to take her for a nice breakfast. Unfortunately, reservations are not available, so she recommended giving a call right before coming in. I had asked if I could bring candles to put in a desert breakfast, and the young lady told me they could provide candles and was very accommodating. When I called back, a gentleman answered the phone and was extremely short with and rude to me. He stated that he did not know if they even had candles and couldn\u2019t get off the phone fast enough. I figured I was speaking to a new employee with little knowledge and asked if it would be easier to ask the manager. The gentleman replied, stating he was the owner! I was shocked. I am so grateful we took our business elsewhere, where we received great service and were able to give my mom a wonderful birthday breakfast with her grandsons! I would definitely recommend NOT going here.",

You are correct that there are no vegan options because we are not a vegan restaurant. All of our food is prepared and cooked on the same surfaces so we cannot claim to be vegan. Our veggie wrap has mixed greens, hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, and Greek dressing inside. I wish you would have let our staff know at the time there was a problem and they could have fixed it at that time. If you would like to speak to us directly, please contact us at provisionswxw@yahoo.com and we will get back to you.

If we do find a comparable gluten free bread that will hold up to the various sandwiches in our kitchen we will be more than happy to offer that. We have just not found one that is comporable. If there was an issue with your salad I wish you would have spoken with us at the time of your visit and we would have corrected any issues at that time.

If you order a drip coffee, the mugs (or to go cups) are next to the register and you can choose either medium or dark roast and add any cream/sweeteners before having a seat. We are not a full service restaurant even though we bus your table after you are finished. I do hope you will return in the future and give us another try.

I apologize that your eggs were not cooked the way you had wanted them to be cooked. When the young man brought your plate back to the kitchen, we had asked him to verify if you wanted them runny or not so we could cook them the way you would liked to have them. He returned to us stating you did not want them runny - so I recooked them over hard for you. We are in the process of training our younger staff on how to handle situations like these in a more professional manner - unfortunately, in this situation, we failed to handle it in a manner to which we did not come across as rude. I do hope you will return and give us another chance - we have a young staff who are learning and we do make mistakes. Please accept this apology and again, we do thank you for taking the time to reach out to us. Please feel free to email us directly at provisionswxw@yahoo.com and provide your contact information should you like to discuss/address further.",

We do still take orders over the phone no problem. We also advise our customers who would like to do so to place their orders online as that is a new option we began offering our customers when we purchased the business in January. Because it is new, we are telling all customers who call in orders that we have that service now. We agree that the online option is not one a person driving should use. Please feel free to call and place an order over the phone if that is more convenient for you to do so - we take several of these types of orders each day. Upon your arrival you can pay for your order at that time via card or cash. We do hope you will return in the future and continue to support our many local vendors represented in the shop.",

My sandwich was okay but could use more meat and more olive spread. Come on, be generous for what we are paying. My son did not like the breakfast bowl but again it had garlic grits in it. Leave the garlic out of your grits and add more salt!",

Provisions dining room shares space with an impressive array of edible novelties.  It's in a restored storefront, half sit down dining room (finished in casual kitchen) with beautiful broad beam flooring, painted wainscot ceiling and enormous glass windows looking to the busy sidewalk...and half vintage hardware store shelving filled with specialty coffees, teas, jams, preserves and much more.  The menu is appealing and our french toast breakfast sandwiches two thick, perfect slices holding egg, cheese, smoky bacon and a perfect complement of a mildly peppery chipotle were done with top shelf ingredients, carefully prepared and were worth a return trip.  The vibe is comfortable, laid back, quality driven at reasonable prices.",

Inside is also a small cafe with a great sandwich menu.  Pricing was reasonable and portion sizes were good and taste was really good.\n\nIf passing through town or nearby, I'd definitely recommend stopping by to eat lunch and check this place out.",

Many of our customers come to us during  their lunch break and have limited amount of time. Being that we are NOT a fast food restaurant,  we like to inform our customers when wait times are longer than usual.  We take into account the call in orders that are continually coming in, the line of customers and any delays in meal prep as best as possible.  We are limited in our seating capacity  (because of covid) as well as the speed in which we are able to prepare the fresh, quality food we are known for.  I don't know if the person ahead of you was picking up a previously called in order,  ordering coffee or purchasing market items,  but I certainly didn't mean to single you out as you insinuated to make you feel as though we don't want your patronage.  We appreciate you and every person who walks through our doors and we hope to see you again.

One thing that was a little frustrating for us was the flow of ordering and waiting around to get an open seat. We were in the store portion but didn\u2019t want to wait outside and miss getting called for our table. So we were inside and constantly having to move around and out of the way with the amount of people coming in and also ordering (not to mention servers running back and forth to the kitchen). Was a little tedious. I\u2019m sure this is all due to COVID and also us coming in for breakfast on the weekend. I would constructively recommend a conventional method of issuing pagers or collecting phone numbers and calling people back to the restaurant so they don\u2019t have to crowd the store. Hope that\u2019s helpful!",

However, this was not clear if it was for dining in  or getting something from storefront. A woman, who was waiting on people seated outside, walked by my wife. My wife asked her if they were seating people. After acting a little inconvenienced that she had to walk around my wife she says curtly, \" yes we're seating, but there's no available tables,\" and walked off leaving it at that. -- Thanks a lot for your \"courtesy\" and good luck with your business. I would suggest a better way of dealing with potential customers would be saying, \" yes, but I'm sorry there's no availability at the moment, if you would like to wait we would be glad to have you\" or something to that effect.

They offer a variety of delicious menu options, from quiche and other scrumptious breakfast goodies to cold or toasted sandwiches and soups. It doesn't hurt that they make the very BEST Reuben in town! Even though all their sandwiches as terrific, I'm very loyal to their homemade soups. My favorite is the tomato basil.\nI love the atmosphere that Provisions offers. After you place your order at the counter you have time to peruse the shelves that are stocked with local goodies!\nIf you haven't been fortunate enough to eat here put it on your TO DO LIST and stop in real soon!\n(if this review helped give it a \ud83d\udc4d)",

If it tells you anything, I drove 45 min out of the way and pushed a meeting back JUST so I could have breakfast here. The funfetti pancakes will ruin your world. Light, fluffy, not overly sweet and the fetti gives it a little sweet crunch. The eggs, VERY fresh, fluffy and scrambled perfectly with cheese. Lastly, the bacon...........just, just.....phenomenal. I have traveled all over the country, eaten breakfast at a lot of places and can honestly say, easily top 3, maybe even #1 breakfast spot I\u2019ve ever been.\n\nMake it a point to try this place, you will not be disappointed. Would give 10 out of 5 stars if I could.",
