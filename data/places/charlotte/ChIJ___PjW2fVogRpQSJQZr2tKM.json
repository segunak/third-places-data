He sighed and said fine...so I attempted to give him cash with a tip included and was told I couldn't that I had to give him the exact amount of $...It turned out I was literally one penny short of the exact change and we ended up in a stand off...thankfully the gentleman who was infront of me in line covered my penny so I was able to get my drink...\nUnfortunately The barista who actually made my drink wasn't a whole lot better with his customer service skills.\nThank goodness the latte was worth it!"

It's bright and conducive to a work or conversation type of environment.\n\nFor the coffee, I only have a partial option ion because I've only tried their cold brew. I'm not a fan at all. The cold brew had a sour taste.  It tasted almost as if they brewed hot coffee, poured it into a pitcher and placed it into the fridge.  The cold brew tasted sour, but not as acidic as hot coffee. Maybe it's the coffee grounds or maybe they have to adjust the coarseness of their grinds.\n\nI make cold brew at home on days I don't feel like going to a coffee house and it doesn't have the same sour taste. So not sure how they are brewing theirs, but it needs to be adjusted. It was nearly as bad as Dunkin Donuts ICED coffee."

I just moved here from Minnesota where we had the likes of Spyhouse and Dogwood coffee roasters (which are the best I've ever had) so it was good to see that Hex is on that same exact level.\n\nAnd to top it off, the staff/owners are great people and very helpful. They showed me how to step up my french press game at home so now I buy all my beans from these guys so I can have Hex at home.\n\nAlso, it's a great place to come get some work done (I work from home) during the day.\n\nBut wait, it gets even better: They have an outstanding beer bottle shop! I know, right? Coffee AND craft beer? Yeah, these guys know exactly what they're doing and I love supporting them. It's great to stop by every morning during my bike ride to get a coffee and then in the evenings stop in for a nice craft draft."
