My friend got the Vietnamese coffee with tapioca boba and I got the lychee green tea with crystal boba. The lychee green tea was so refreshing as it was pretty warm that day. The Vietnamese coffee\u2019s flavors complimented each other so well. Third, the owner was so nice and he has so many ideas for his shop. The owner stoped and talked with us while we sipped on our drinks. He sounds so passionate about his shop and is trying to cater his menu based on what his customers want. If you like boba drinks and cuteness please check it out. Not a lot of sitting room but the cups are super portable so you can shop and sip!",

Guilty. Crane machines? Also guilty. Vietnamese coffee and lychee green tea? You clearly know how to order like a boba boss. \ud83d\ude0e\nIt was such a joy chatting with you both\u2014my brain is basically a bubble tea shaker, always mixing up new ideas, so thank you for letting me ramble while you sipped. I\u2019m on a mission to make this place the unofficial HQ of tasty drinks and chaotic cuteness, and your kind words just fueled me like a double shot of espresso boba.\nAlso, yes, our seating situation is basically \u201cmusical chairs but with no music and fewer chairs,\u201d so we made sure our cups are ready for adventure. Shop, sip, conquer the world. \ud83d\udcaa\nCome back soon\u2014we\u2019ll save a plushie seat for you (or at least a crane machine that almost lets you win). \ud83d\udc3b\n",

We stopped by on their 3rd day of opening and these guys are definitely working their tails off to  make things as smoothly as possible. They were also very nice as well.\n\nIf the owner sees this, best of luck. Breathe and relax, we understand that it's a new establishment. You're doing great so far.",

My friend got the Vietnamese coffee with tapioca boba and I got the lychee green tea with crystal boba. The lychee green tea was so refreshing as it was pretty warm that day. The Vietnamese coffee\u2019s flavors complimented each other so well. Third, the owner was so nice and he has so many ideas for his shop. The owner stoped and talked with us while we sipped on our drinks. He sounds so passionate about his shop and is trying to cater his menu based on what his customers want. If you like boba drinks and cuteness please check it out. Not a lot of sitting room but the cups are super portable so you can shop and sip!",

We stopped by on their 3rd day of opening and these guys are definitely working their tails off to  make things as smoothly as possible. They were also very nice as well.\n\nIf the owner sees this, best of luck. Breathe and relax, we understand that it's a new establishment. You're doing great so far.",
