They had places to climb and they could get away from the humans if they wanted to. All the cats were so sweet and playful. The hour went way too quickly!

I stopped by to kill some time on a staycation from work and figured I'd check out the cat room and read for a bit. How naive of me. I spent a majority of my hour reservation (walk ins are 30 mins, many slots open last night when I booked) playing with Moonstone. I picked up a toy just seconds after walking in and she ran up to me with laser focus. She is as energetic and playful as she is beautiful (her eyes and the PINK in her nose ). She also let me get a few pets in, but didn't want to be so affectionate when she was trained on that toy. So I let her play herself out. And she was very entertaining. Lots of bunny hops, dives, sploots, and butt shakes. Someone go get her. I'm full up with my two at home and my eldest already wants to be the solo star of the show, but I know she will bring someone a lot of joy.\n\nI do regret getting a canned drink and not trying their coffee, but I can attest it smelled very good and will use that as an excuse to visit again."

The building is a beautiful old 1886 building that is sadly smushed in between two modern soulless seven-story apartment boxes.  Inside there's a small coffee shop area and the separate cat room.  The cat room typically has about 12 cats (all adoptable) and you can play with them or just watch them have fun, you're only asked not to pick them up or handle them but you can certainly pet them and get cuddles from them if they climb into your lap!\n\nThe staff is excellent, the cats are healthy and friendly, the price is reasonable, and the facility is comfortable.

            "review_text": "Hello all! If there has ever been a hard review for me to write, it is this one. I have been debating it for days, but I decided it's a big enough issue that I should follow through with it. I'd like to preface by saying that me and my boyfriend have come to the Charlotte Mac Tabby location for 3+ years. We have been loyal customers. It's a date we always look forward to and count the days down on!\n\nLast Wednesday I had a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy with the addition of a surprise laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation. I decided to book a one-hour kitty date for me and my boyfriend, who goes to college in Virginia and came to visit me during this difficult time of my life, for that Saturday to get me out of the house. Oh boy! I woke up that morning feeling the worst I had since the surgery, it was rough but I decided the date would be worth it. Or so I thought.\n\nFor those used to the Charlotte location, you know there is a troublesome flight of stairs leading up to the door. About 20-30. I had told my boyfriend to stay behind me in case I fall or become weak, as this was the first time I had been out of the house since surgery as well as the first flight of stairs I walked up. For some reason, a worker of Mac Tabby (white, middle-aged+, average height male) who was sweeping the area above the stairs decided it would be the perfect time to make side comments about how \"it must be such a workout going up those stairs\" for me. We did not respond at first, as I was more concerned with not tripping over my own feet, however; he did not let this stop him. He continued making the same comment 2 or 3 more times about the stairs being \"such a workout\" for me. Once I got to the top of the stairs I informed him I had surgery, but rather than apologize he doubled down and said once more how rough it must be to walk up some stairs with a sarcastic tone. Wow, how kind.\n\nI tried to not let it bother me at first, although later I lost that battle and brought it up to a worker who seemed to understand where I was coming from and decided to get the owner involved. Once the owner came over she did not seem as understanding. At all. Right off the bat, how I felt was dismissed by her and she made excuses for him saying they say that to each other all the time and there's no way he could've known I had surgery. That's the point! You are coworkers, you know each other. He does NOT KNOW ME! Or what I've been through!! I am highly disappointed that it took me showing this lady my stitches and bruises for her to act as if she knew where I was coming from. Bottom line, don't make comments about your customers you do with your coworkers. Do not make comments with them, especially ones that can be taken as very rude and demeaning. You do not know what people struggle with every day. Some people have disabilities, and climbing those stairs may be the hardest part of their day- don't be a jackass about it! Don't make it harder! I don't care if you make comments to each other at work, be careful who you say that shit to because I am not your coworker I am a paying customer who crawled out of her bed after a very rough surgery to try to have a better day. This experience demonstrates a lack of management understanding. Which is upsetting since me and my boyfriend really loved the experience this place brought us.\n\nNeedless to say, me and my boyfriend will not be back to this location. We will try our luck at other locations and pray we don't have workers make comments about our body there. This has been a disappointing experience, to say the least.\n\nTheir drinks are pretty good though and the cats are innocent in all this. Adopt them!!"

One thing I love about the cat lounge area is it feels so homey like you're in someone's living room. This is one of the best cat Cafe I've visited and I've been to many. I still reminisce about this place."

It was without a doubt a great experience in every way! There was ZERO smell. It was SUPER clean. Like no cat hair anywhere!  I had no allergy reactions at all. The cafe is decorated so quirky and yet so aesthetically pleasing. I had the apple crisp latte and my daughter had the honey lavender. Both were soooooo good (thanks Julia!). Staff was friendly and engaged with customers and cats but not over the top. The cats were friendly and the cat room was spacious. If I were a cat I'd want to go there and hang out. The focus on adoption and the love they all have for rescues and for the cats is intentional. And I  felt  that in every  part of this cafe. It was a great experience and I will absolutely be back!"

We walked in and were able to play with the kitties for $10 per person for 30 minutes. You can also book online in advance! We played and watched the cats! Was so much fun!

My partner was told that any watering eyes or sneezing is normal for kittens as they adjust, but within days this developed into a cold. His kitten now has red watery eyes and tons of sneezes.Usually, this is not a problem as most organizations will offer a low cost visit at an affiliated clinic and help the kitten they just adopted. However, after paying $140 for an adoption fee, which is steep and more than I've ever paid for my healthy humane society cats, they essentially told him to go find his own vet after a WEEK from his adoption date. Like I said before, the baby's eyes were watery the DAY AFTER he got the kitten and they did not take the situation seriously. Just be warned that this organization facilitates over priced adoptions under the guise that the cats have been vetted but really they have been given shots, months prior, and they have no idea on the kittens current condition! Save yourself the $70-90 and just head down to the humane society where they will actually vet your pet and provide you with medicine if they are sick."

There is a small cafe section to buy drinks and etc, but you do not have to buy anything to go into the cat lounge. The cat lounge costs $10 and a reservation slot is required. We didn't know this but we walked in and were able to go in after ~30 minutes.\n\nThese cats are up for adoption so basically if you like a certain cat you can adopt it, I believe that is how it works. I will say that - you should not expect constant playtime with them because these cats are toyed around with humans all day - do not be sad if they are sitting there sleeping because they cannot always be playing around. 4/5"

Here's just a few things that make it such a special place to me\n1. Kitty cats! All cats adoptable and vetted by the rescue they work with to ensure their cats are placed in a suitable environment that meets all their needs. Not every cat is a \"cafe cat\" but Mac Tabby's cats are some of the most social/outgoing cats you'll meet. The rescue and cafe does such a great job at making sure these cats are taken care of and going to the home they deserve.\n2. Friendly Staff. You will always see smiling faces when you walk in and everyone their seems to really enjoy their job. They are very kind and helpful towards customers and the kitties.\n3. Drinks! Definitely one of my favorite places for coffee. They have soooo many options to choose from and they can personalize almost anything you order! If you're allergic to cats, you still gotta come for the coffee, because their cafe area is cat free and just a very cozy environment to relax and watch kitties from the windows.\n4. Atmosphere and location. Mac Tabby Charlotte is located in the cool hippy like area of Noda. Very beautiful place to spend the day. The atmosphere of the cafe is very pleasant, spunky and comfortable.\n\nAll in all I give this place 100 stars! You need to visit this place! You will leave with the biggest smile on your face(:"

We had a WONDERFUL experience other than the lady who waited on us at our first visit - she was surprisingly a little nasty.  EVERYBODY else was totally GREAT!  We had been told not to bother with reservations which totally turned out to not be true.  MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!  ;-)  After getting a reservation then arriving later the same day, we went to the kitty lounge.  It's a 10 person limit in the lounge so our party of 8 (plus two others) was easily accomodated.\n\nWe did not get any food but the drinks we had were awesome. All 4 kids and 4 adults were super impressed with the drinks!\n\nOur one hour long segment with the cats in the lounge area was soooo sweet and yes - therapeutic!  The atmosphere was totally chill, from the staff to the kitties.  A couple of staff members were in the lounge and were very helpful with the kids engaging the kitties and answering all the questions from everybody.  The cats varied in type, age, color and disposition but without kittens (waaah) and yes, they are available for adoption.  The cat visit segment was just so great, I cannot put it into words.\n\nThe only (very small) problem that we had on the day we visited (6/30/2023) had nothing to do with Mac Tabby Cat Cafe nor the sort of nasty lady - there is a LOT of construction going on around the Mac Tabby location and hardly any parking available nearby.  HOWEVER, there is a nice free-parking(!!!) garage a very short 1/2 block away - so short that I didn't even work up a sweat on a 93 degree F day!\nBottom line:  Yes, we ALLL loved Mac Tabby!  Yes, we ALLL heartily recommend Mac Tabby!  And YES!  We will be back again on our next visit to North Carolina!"

            "review_text": "SO impressed! MacTabby turned out to be one of our favorite stops while visiting Charlotte/Concord. I had heard of cat cafes before and while I would not consider myself a cat person (allergies) I always thought the concept was genius and would not hesitate to support it. As a result, we decided on an afternoon coffee after a hike and made the drive down to MacTabby. The cafe portion of the experience was great. The coffee flavors/options were unique and I had a hard time narrowing my selections down to something I would like because everything seemed awesome. This is separate and sectioned off so you can have your beverage in a different location and NOT socialize with the cats if you don't want to. The cat portion of the experience was so sweet. I took some allergy meds and just went for it...It was $8 for 30 minutes and the kitties were so social. Very friendly, very cute and very well cared for. Overall this was a wonderful experience that comes highly recommended if you're looking for a cat to adopt and/or just need some time with a little kitty that wants to be loved on."

This isn't Mac Tabby's fault at all. Just a reminder to everyone going. Especially since these cats are up for adoption we want everyone to get a chance to meet all the cats!!"

It almost felt like we were visiting inmates at a prison with their demeanor. Didn't offer a drink, had to ask about ordering a coffee. The whole time we were in there they were just watching us intensely as we played with the cats. It was very overbearing to say the least. They then asked us to leave and didn't care to honor my whole hour. It was not special at all. Was very disappointed."

We were free to move around and visit with several of the kittens; some were sleeping, some were active and playful. I was pretty excited that we could bring toys for them as well - as soon as we got there one of them practically jumped into my bag to get the catnip mice out :) Though we didn't get anything at the cafe', I like that there was a pretty big assortment and that you could bring your selection into the cat room with you (or they'd bring it in to you if you were already there). Knowing that a small fee goes to help so many of these wonderful cats, I'd be visiting there weekly if I lived in the area. I will absolutely make another stop in the next time I'm in the area."

I know this isn't strictly the cafes fault but I witness some children being super aggressive with the cats until they almost attacked. (Ex- shoving toys in their face, putting hands and fingers in their face when they're clearly annoyed, shoving toys in the employee only room where the litter boxes are, etc.) My only suggestion is allowing slots for people that are 18+ only, just to give older people time to unwind and interact/meet with the cats without kids present. Regardless awesome and friendly staff and great selection of drinks and cute kitties!"
