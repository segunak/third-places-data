If you're a fan of empanadas, they're definitely worth trying.\n\nSince I don't drink coffee, I wouldn't come back for the matcha, but if that's not your main focus, the spot itself has a nice vibe and apparently coffee is great.\n\nJust keep in mind that it can get pretty crowded, and finding a table might be tricky."

Whether you're stopping in for a quick bite or settling in for a work session, the setup is perfect. Their co-working space invites people from all over the city to connect, collaborate, and create. And if you prefer to soak in the energy of Plaza Midwood, their outdoor seating is the perfect spot to enjoy a cup of coffee while watching the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood.\n\nI also love their \"depot spot\" inside the Dowd YMCA, making it easy to grab a quality cup of coffee after a workout and before heading to work.\n\nThe ownership team is phenomenal--you can tell they are not just passionate about coffee but also deeply committed to their customers. They have truly created a space that blends community, quality, and comfort in the best way possible.\n\nHighly recommend checking out Giddy Goat--you won't be disappointed!"

Later on I spoke to someone  that he said he is a manager and requested that please take this accident as a learning experience as when handing coffee to customers please put lids on all the time to avoid situations like this in the future.

The sugar shaker is wet at the top, so the sugar does not come out. Again, the section to prepare your coffee is filthy. The girl at the girl at the counter is rude.

The reviews were super good and the menu looked perfectly simple. The staff was very friendly and shop was warm and cozy. We went on a rainy, cold morning so it was a perfect place to go to. We both got iced vanilla lattes, despite it being 30 degrees outside, and they were so delicious!! You could really taste the fresh coffee bean flavor and it was a super yummy tasting coffee. I'm not a coffee connoisseur and I usually don't like the taste of actual coffee, whoever, this changed my mind on liking that robust flavor with my sweet latte!! I was very impressed!! My boyfriend got the empanadas for a snack and he said they were absolutely delicious as well. He crushed them! If I were to go back to Charlotte, I would for sure stop here again! It seemed like a local hotspot too!"

I ordered an empanada the size slightly larger than a tortellini, that was $4. My friend also ordered an empanada, which was much larger. I inquired why mine was sizably smaller and was told that they used a different \"fold\". The attitude was sort of like, whatever do you want the empanada? I've got to get to my next customer. First of all, how do you charge someone the same amount for less food. This reminds of the Robert De Niro scene in the movie Casino where he required every blueberry muffin to have the exact same amount of blueberries. Secondly, the attitude and vibe is all wrong. Needless to say, I will never visit this establishment again. Back to friendlier water at Undercurrent."

The coffee was overly acidic and had a burnt flavor, making it far from enjoyable. The matcha was incredibly disappointing--essentially tasteless, like drinking green-colored milk. The empanadas and pastry were mediocre at best, nothing memorable or worth recommending.\n\nThat said, the service was above average, and the staff were friendly and attentive, which was a bright spot in the visit. The general atmosphere inside was also pleasant and welcoming, but sadly, the quality of the food and drinks just didn't match the ambiance. It's a decent spot for the vibe, but the menu leaves much to be desired."

I tried the iced coffee (hoping for it with milk + sugar, but got plain coffee with Ice - not a big deal for me). The receptionist was quick and prompt. The baked Blueberry muffin and Dulce de Leche Croissant was 10/10. They were fresh and perfect! Will definitely go back for the baked goods and maybe try a Sweetend Milk Iced coffee next time. Note for a heads up- their Iced Coffee has no sugar no milk, just Ice and plain coffee, which was surprisingly so good when I added a touch of sweetener after nevertheless."

You have two choices; go to the place with the long line and boring coffee because they don't know any better, or go here.  Yes there is a line but something is different.  The vibe is actually authentic vs. corporate, the coffee is actually well done (look at the sludge at the bottom of your cup from that other place), and the food is actually made right there vs someone opening a frozen breakfast thing and tossing it in a microwave for $10.  I get it: parking is tight, but why?  BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!!  You have a choice right now: trust me, try this place."

So I figured that was all theirs. After waiting a few minutes, I asked about the empanada. The cashier said \"it was right there you've been standing right there the whole time how did you not see it??\" I said I'm sorry I think someone else took it... She did give me another empanada but I didn't understand the attitude when how could I have known which one was mine."

I tend to be quite picky about coffee, as lots of cafes in the area often leave me disappointed, but not Giddy Goat. I've been here a few times now, and have had multiple different drinks, and they're all great. Recently, I had a Vietnamese cold brew here, and it quite literally is my favorite cup of coffee i've ever had. Super light and creamy, it had a similar experience to drinking a beer as it had a head and a base, it was phenomenal. I've also had a couple scones from here and they were great, I can't speak for the empanadas as I haven't tried them, but they look great. Overall, this place has all 5 stars for me. Great atmosphere, one of the best for coffee shops in the area, and the coffee is the best in my opinion. This is my go to for coffee, and you should try it too, you won't be disappointed."

The shop had some cute merch and coffee beans too. Clean bathroom.  The only hard part is parking. Close parking is hard to find and so we went to  a paid lot and it was 10 dollars for 2 hours. A little spendy but the area is cute. We walked around a little bit up and down the street to get some more time in. All in all, I would highly recommend."

Since it's always busy here the parking lot is regularly full. Furthermore... the empanadas. The flavor is on point. I've tried every empanada and honestly I love them but sometimes I can't get past the raw dough in the middle and on the bottom. They need a minimum of another 5 minutes in the oven since they aren't fried. Check the bottoms! I would love to see the crust a more golden brown across the entire pastry and not just a few spots on the top.\n\nPros: coffee! Love that they roast their own coffee. It's delicious. The staff that serves it up is always polite, personable, and kind. The overall environment at giddy goat is amazing. A great sense of community. You can tell that people love coming here. The atmosphere is perfect for meet ups, business, college students, family. I also love that GG does coffee and workouts, yoga and coffee, and dance lessons. There's also live music almost every week and tons of local art for sale.\n\nI come here regularly and will continue to do so. As soon as I see those empanadas not as raw.. the 5th star will come.\n\nI wish y'all great business!\n\nReview update 12/20/23\n\nAsked for more color on the empanadas.. got more color on them. They are glorious! Rich golden brown and crispy outside. As always the flavor is on point."

It isn't that it was bad, but my taste buds would prefer a chai latte or another specialty coffee over this. However, the empanadas were phenomenal! The meat was super tender inside the patagonia empanada and the spinach empanada was packed with a tasty filling. They were both flakey and delicious. The chimichurri and red sauce both paired well with the empanadas too. There is indoor and outdoor seating, and they also have a small parking lot. If you strike out on the parking lot, there is additional street parking that isn't too hard to find in the area. I will definitely be back here again for empanadas in the future!"

They truly are leading the way in how coffee shops are ran. They compost and welcome you to bring your own cup. All while using reusable cups for in house purchases. They also compost working with Queen City compost. They have amazing food, especially the empanadas! I had their vegan empanadas today and they were delicious, filling, and mouthwatering. They also have vegan cinnamon bread and vegan lemon power balls! For non vegans there is also so many lovely, delicious items to choose from. My favorite before going vegan are their croissants. The chocolate croissants are a must try! They also offer space to rent for parties, gatherings, and buisness.\n\nI remember when this place opened and I am so happy to see Giddy Goat thriving. Please visit this coffee shop and bring your own cup if you have one!"

The service was 10/10-the perfect blend of polite and prompt.

I ordered a large black coffee but it appears there is only one size. I was given a cup filled to the top (appreciated at the time) without a sleeve. My fingers were on fire carrying the cup to the stand with lids and sleeves. Once in the car and moving, the lid was not fitting properly and that full cup was spilling all over my hand and interior.\nI would suggest drinking on site."
