However, the customer service is so awful. They girls just look at you in the face like you\u2019re stupid. I ask questions and they give me one word answers. I asked for a remake because the chai was awful and they just looked and said can\u2019t. For a 9$ chai that\u2019s ridiculous. They are just plain rude and because of that I am done with this location and will not be coming back. For a place that charges you 9$ for a chai you would think the staff would be kind. If you want good customer service, here is not the place.",

The versatile seating options both inside and outside the shop were perfect for accommodating my large group of 50 guests. The space provided an ideal setup for a DJ, a designated area for dancing, a Photo Booth, and even room for catered BBQ meal, complete with a selection of wine and beer at counter.\n\nThe service provided by Summit Coffee was exceptional, and the owners went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. Their accommodating nature and abundance of fantastic ideas added an extra layer of magic to the event. If you are in search of the perfect venue for your next gathering, I wholeheartedly recommend considering Summit Coffee- it exceeded all of my expectations.",

Not many people realize we do catering and also rent our space out for parties, social groups, and other events.

You also brought in you most of your own food and set up a buffet on the bar which is a good way to save some money.

Street parking is sometimes available (pay attention to towing zone signs), but the parking situation was frustrating at best and definitely put a damper on my experience.\nOnce I found a place to park, I walked in to the calming, familiar teal interior of the caf\u00e9. Baristas were\u2026 not my favorite. They weren\u2019t explicitly rude, but very cold and seemed annoyed at me questioning the menu. Asked if any sweets were dairy free, barista just shrugged. That\u2019s okay\u2014they weren\u2019t marked, I didn\u2019t expect barista to know but a verbal response would have been appreciated.\nHowever, the biggest reason for the three stars is that NONE of the cold foam drinks can be made dairy-free. In 2023, it is ridiculous that they REFUSE to do this, even Sbux can do it for some drinks! I didn\u2019t even bother asking them to use sanitized equipment for my drink after hearing this. I got the (seasonal, I think) lavender honey latte, but did not enjoy the charge for DF milk, as other Summit locations don\u2019t have this.\nAll in all, the Plaza location is only 10 minutes away and far better than this one.",

I completely understand your frustration with parking, it\u2019s never ideal around the city but there are also crews working on water lines and shutting down portions of the street, which has added to the parking limitations.  \nAll Summit locations use the same drink menu and same ingredients to provide consistency across the entire brand. We do have a small upcharge for specialty milks to cover the added cost, which is not uncommon at some of the Summit locations. We put a lot of thought into making sure our prices are reasonable.\nWe do appreciate you coming in and providing us with some valuable insight. Since we recently opened, we are in the process of training several new baristas, but I\u2019m encouraged by their eagerness to provide exceptional customer service. We hope that you might give us another try in the future.\n\nThank you,",

I asked for a remake because the chai was awful and they just looked and said can\u2019t. For a 9$ chai that\u2019s ridiculous. They are just plain rude and because of that I am done with this location and will not be coming back. For a place that charges you 9$ for a chai you would think the staff would be kind.

Yes, we were hoping to be a busy cafe so we decided to purchase a Eversys espresso machine upon opening. We really like that it makes very good consistent espresso a bit faster than more manual machines. As I'm sure you are aware, it's more about the coffee beans then it is about the machine and we really do serve a fantastic espresso. Our Kilimanjaro, like all our our beans are roasted by the Summit Coffee Roastery just up the road in Cornelius. This allows us to control the quality and you know your always getting the freshest coffee in your cup. Thank you so much for the great review. We hope to see you again soon. ",

Our coffee is sourced from multiple regions and roasted locally by the Summit Coffee Roastery. Many of the farms are women owned. We really do spend a lot of time and effort to make sure we are serving not just great coffee, but also coffee with diverse and interesting flavor profiles. Our fresh pastries are homemade in house or provided by the Summit Bakery. Thanks again for your recent visit and we look forward to seeing you again in the future. ",

The venue\u2019s expansive windows offered breathtaking views, creating a truly stunning atmosphere as the evening unfolded. The versatile seating options both inside and outside the shop were perfect for accommodating my large group of 50 guests. The space provided an ideal setup for a DJ, a designated area for dancing, a Photo Booth, and even room for catered BBQ meal, complete with a selection of wine and beer at counter.\n\nThe service provided by Summit Coffee was exceptional, and the owners went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. Their accommodating nature and abundance of fantastic ideas added an extra layer of magic to the event. If you are in search of the perfect venue for your next gathering, I wholeheartedly recommend considering Summit Coffee- it exceeded all of my expectations.",

Street parking is sometimes available (pay attention to towing zone signs), but the parking situation was frustrating at best and definitely put a damper on my experience.\nOnce I found a place to park, I walked in to the calming, familiar teal interior of the caf\u00e9. Baristas were\u2026 not my favorite. They weren\u2019t explicitly rude, but very cold and seemed annoyed at me questioning the menu. Asked if any sweets were dairy free, barista just shrugged. That\u2019s okay\u2014they weren\u2019t marked, I didn\u2019t expect barista to know but a verbal response would have been appreciated.\nHowever, the biggest reason for the three stars is that NONE of the cold foam drinks can be made dairy-free. In 2023, it is ridiculous that they REFUSE to do this, even Sbux can do it for some drinks! I didn\u2019t even bother asking them to use sanitized equipment for my drink after hearing this. I got the (seasonal, I think) lavender honey latte, but did not enjoy the charge for DF milk, as other Summit locations don\u2019t have this.\nAll in all, the Plaza location is only 10 minutes away and far better than this one.",

I completely understand your frustration with parking, it\u2019s never ideal around the city but there are also crews working on water lines and shutting down portions of the street, which has added to the parking limitations.  \nAll Summit locations use the same drink menu and same ingredients to provide consistency across the entire brand. We do have a small upcharge for specialty milks to cover the added cost, which is not uncommon at some of the Summit locations. We put a lot of thought into making sure our prices are reasonable.\nWe do appreciate you coming in and providing us with some valuable insight. Since we recently opened, we are in the process of training several new baristas, but I\u2019m encouraged by their eagerness to provide exceptional customer service. We hope that you might give us another try in the future.\n\nThank you,",
