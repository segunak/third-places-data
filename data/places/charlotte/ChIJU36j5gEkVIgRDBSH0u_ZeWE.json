The concept is locomotives, so the interior exposed brick, hard metal accent pieces, and even names of beverages all point in the same direction. The customer service is incredible and usually has the same faces, so getting to know the staff on a first name basis is very common. The bakery they contract with is a local non-profit and puts out amazing products. They also have other food related items for purchase for convenience. Where it all matters, because upscale coffee shops are white noise these days, the beans and roast are impeccable. I've tried a little bit of everything on their menu and the espresso is very high level. I highly recommend the Ticket to London. Pricing is on-point and reasonable considering the quality of product and location of business. What I really enjoyed, just as much as the rest of the aforementioned aspects, was the customer demographic. You get a variety of everyone in there, but yet it doesn't feel overcrowded, overhyped, or commercialized. It's just a good local spot with great coffee and top shelf staff. I highly recommend.

But I love getting the queen bee and adding an extra shot for flavor! The music is hit or miss for me. But never distracting or obnoxious. The muffins are lovely and the gluten free baked goods are so tasty. The folks who serve are lovely. And the aesthetic of the shop is nice. I love the old photos in the bathrooms, all the natural light and the fountain outside in the back, the hardwood flooring. And the artwork, notebooks, pens, mugs etc are wonderful. Absolutely lovely spot to hang in the spring and fall! They really did a wonderful job with the space they have. Just wish the coffee game was bumped up a bit. ;) that would be the icing on the cake!

Love the White House setting with the trees perfectly grown around to give the yards enough shades and lovely views to enjoy your coffee.

It is a bit bitter for me but everyone else seems to like it, come try for yourself !! Excellent service."

I actually had a gift card too so it was the perfect opportunity to use it.\n\nThey were super friendly and when we had 29 cents left after our gift card, they just said not to worry about it. Our drinks were ready quickly and were the perfect temperature to drink right away--very warm, but not burn your tongue hot.\n\nThere was a perfectly delicious hint of cookie butter and the chai was delicious. It wasn't the overly sweet stuff you find at a lot of places. You'll find a spicy, flavorful chai here.\n\nI'll definitely stop by again sometime!"

The atmosphere is great, the staff is awesome, and the prices are surprisingly decent. However, almost every coffee that I've ordered, hot or cold, has had almost no taste to it whatsoever. I do not put much dairy in my coffee to begin with, but I always ask them to go light because of this, and even then my drinks still barely taste like coffee. If they can figure out how to make some stronger coffee and/or fix the coffee-to-milk ratio, I'll gladly bump this up to 5 stars."

Not only is this little coffee shop a great local hangout spot but this coffee shop has become a meeting place for all sorts of events. Local city officials and politicians use this as a meet and greet place to discuss local issues and policy. Always worth a stop in when walking through uptown matthews."

            "review_text": "Really cool coffee shop in Matthews. Matthews has never had a coffee shop like this so it's great to have them here. Coffee and drinks are great here. Staff is nice and their shop is very clean and has a lot of seating options inside and outside. They sell merchandise as well along with coffee to take home to brew yourself which is cool. Definitely recommend Brakeman."
