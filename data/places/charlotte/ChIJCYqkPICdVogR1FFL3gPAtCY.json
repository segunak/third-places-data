No one told her she couldn't re-enter. Absolutely ridiculous, as this is the only location I have come across that does this. I have been to three other libraries in the area, all within the same system, and none of them have had an issue with people walking in late. Very disappointing. I will not be back."

Unfortunately the children's library area was disappointing.\n\nI have a young child who cannot read yet, he can pick a few books and then wants to engage with other library activities while I browse for age appropriate stories for him and his sibling. At our previous libraries this involved Legos/duplos coloring pages, a white board with letter magnets and markers, computers etc etc. Here there was absolutely nothing for him to do the whole time. The computers were turned off for screen free Friday. There was a very fun looking play area that was closed and locked. There was a sign saying to put toys back but no toys aside from a few puppets and a board puzzle. No acknowledgement from a scowling librarian.\n\nThe only thing to do was play outside which I had to be outside with him and then could not browse the books. I have been to many libraries but never been to one with so little to do! Modern libraries should be a warm and fun place children look forward to visiting and then came home with armfuls of books. Not a boring place with all the fun locked off. If they are going to turn all the computers off and lock the play area they should be providing a variety of other activities in plain sight for children."

And this was all in front a staff help desk not far away. And not a single one of these staff members did a thing about it. Don't believe me? Listen to the video clips I took and imagine trying to concentrate with that going on for a good 2 or 3 hours."

The staff at the help desk right inside the door are not so friendly. They don't make eye contact. It is common courtesy to say hello or have a great day when people walk by you. I think we have had one, maybe two people out of our total visits acknowledge our existence. We have been attending storytime just about every week for several months."

Headphones or earbuds are an absolute must and even with them you can hear conversations. Even in the so called \"quiet study\" room conversations can be heard. This is not simply the people in the library but the workers as well that can often be found huddled and chatting loudly.

Social distancing is in place as even though at the time that I visited it was only myself and two other people in there and I only was in there all of 10mins. They have self checkout and if you need to use the computer to print since they are in Level 2 status right now there is no fee to print and they will give you a guest pass to do so, so you will only really need your library card to scan to check out . Would highly recommend this library without any reservations to you and your family!"

Customer service was nonexistent, which surprised me, because it was everything at the small rural library system I worked at. Their books were poorly shelved, which was disappointing for such a large library. The children's area was nice, but I really didn't feel comfortable with the children's librarians scowling at me. If I felt that way as a 37 year old woman, I can only imagine how the kids must feel. No one feels approachable here. Honestly, I bought the non-resident card to get access to a larger amount of books, but from here on out, I'll only visit the library to pick up holds. I won't come here to spend some time, we'll go to our own dinky library for that. At least the people at ours seem happy to see us."

There was about 5 of them. They were having a good time playing with the hand puppets and got a little too excited and started chasing each other in a circle in a small area- again in the KID'S section. An older woman who worked there quickly came over and started scolding the kids for running and saying \"if you need to run so bad have your parents take you to the park\" mind you it was about to storm outside but that's besides the point. Basically, yes they should not have been running and yes a library is not a place for that kind of play but the librarian could have at least given them a warning first before the harsh words or picked a nicer approach to her message such as letting the parents know they need to settle down. These kids were all under the age of 5. Will not be returning."
