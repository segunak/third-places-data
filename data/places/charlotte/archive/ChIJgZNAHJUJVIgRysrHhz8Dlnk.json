We pulled up to the 1st window and waited what felt like forever, with just one car in front of us, no signs saying stay here to order, no one at window. No one ever came to the 1st window, so we pulled up the 2nd window, and then one of the girls came to the window and then asked us to put the truck into reverse to the 1st window.  Yes, she seemed nice but, then you could feel the aggravation with us, and the other girl she was working with, and kept calling her name (that started with an A, to not put her name out there) and then we asked about pastries and she called for the other girl and never helped her and then went and checked she just seemed Very Frustrated.\nPut our order in, and I guess to sit at 2nd window again for an extended time. Watching the (2 girls) talk to people at the front counter, and waited what felt like way too long for 2 drinks, and 2 Pastries. Then she shoved the boxed items out the window, and No thank you, No have a Nice day...Nothing. The coffees were OK (5/10), (all the syrup was at the bottom :/ even though you had to try to stir the iced one with the straw that kept bending which I recommend a stronger straw if such thing. Pastries seemed like from \"Sams\"  tasted good, but everything was Over Priced. We were the only ones in the drive thru for 20+mins. The girl who ever she is could have made this better, but if they don't have enough help, or if the help isn't helping then this is what is going to happen every time.  The Friendly vibe wasn't there and what she tried just felt like attitude when we had questions.\n\nLong Wait time, Not Friendly, Over Priced for Just OK Coffee, and attitude is Not worth it."

It's always mostly milk- God bless the baristas, but they don't know how to make espresso or coffee drinks. I recommend the coffee shop vibes but I don't recommend the coffee.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you to the owner for offering to remake my drink. I wasn't able to make it back there til last week but I got it remade and it did not disappoint. Wonderful customer service, thank you again, for offering to remake it for me. I will be back "

The young lady was nice and took my order. I walked over and sat with the gentleman. About 20 min. went by and no-one got there coffee. I finally walked back up and could not find the worker. She finally came out I I told her I had an appointment and could not wait any longer! Come to find out she was the only worker in the store....handling drive thru and walk-in business! I would ask that if the owner reads this, you need to have  the RIGHT AMOUNT of staff at all times!! I look forward to your response! And yes I have been in the restaurant business for many years!

That I should \"stick to remote positions in the future.\"\nThey don't even pay their employees well near enough ($9/hr).\nBut just to hear those things in reference to my disability and them not even seeing me or considering anything else I'm capable of doing?\nThat hurt. A lot.\nThey claim to be Christian and \"Go by the Lord\".... I'm not sure I believe that anymore. For the Lord would've found a way to include me instead of exclude me just because of my wheelchair use.\nAnd to deny someone a job because of a disability is ILLEGAL mind you.\nBut it's not worth my time nor my energy to get into it with their conceded little minds."

During my 12 minute wait I watched yhe employees clumsily and slowly set up for business setting iut what looked too be days old grocery store bought pastries marked up to fresh bakery prices.  Its a good thing your salvation comes from the grace of God and not your business.  Terrible place, Ill never return .

            "review_text": "Came to the Holy Grind this morning for the first time. Everyone raves about it. After today I'm not sure why. I ordered an iced caramel macchiato with oat milk and the cheese danish. I spent $10 and I tipped a dollar. When she handed me my drink I noticed that the label said whole milk. So I asked her if it did in fact have whole milk that I wont be able to drink it because it will make me sick. And that I had asked for oat milk. She tells me that the label maker just prints it out that way and that it should be fine. I could tell that it was regular milk. As someone who cannot drink it, you definitely notice it when it's in your presence. I told her that I wasn't comfortable with drinking it because if it is in fact whole milk I will get sick. So if she could just please check to make sure. She takes the drink and is gone for a few minutes. Comes back and says I think I fixed it and everything should be fine now, and tells me again it's just the way that the printer prints out the label. The drink that she gives me looks extremely watered down. I take one sip and it just tastes like water. My theory (because I didn't see what she did with my drink) is that she took my drink, dumped out the whole milk and then filled it with water. I was so disappointed. I just ended up leaving. Can't tell you how the Danish is as I still haven't eaten it yet. I feel like the concern for the wrong type of milk being put in wasn't taken very seriously and I wish that they would have just made things right by remaking the drink the right way. Now I am out $11 and wasted a 40 minute drive."

I got my order in a timely manner, however it did not taste good at all.  It tasted like watered down coffee with a splash of oat milk. Couldn't even taste the pumpkin.  When the lady handed me the cup, I asked her if it was the large because it looked way too small for a $9 drink. (Way more expensive than Starbucks). She said yes with an attitude and shut the window so fast I couldn't even finish confirming it was the right drink.  I didn't have time to go in and get it fixed.\nThe reason I felt the need to leave a review is because I usually love supporting Christian coffee shops but something was off.  I know people have bad days, but there was a bad vibe.\nI did like all the decor!"

First off the pay is horrible and  the managers took away the barista's electronic tips. They claimed that they were being taxed twice.I know many ppl you work in the restaurant industry and  asked them about the double taxation on credit card tips. Every single one told me that, that wasn't true... if the baristas gave the managers an idea on how to do something better the managers would belittle their idea and act like that only their ideas were the only good ones. I personally had the managers steal a prize that I had won for selling the most gift cards at Christmas. They keep the pastries in a refrigerator that doesn't even work. There have been several times that the pastries have had mold on them bc they were not stored properly. Also our caramel, chocolate and white chocolate would be filled every night. They never let the bottles run completely out so we could wash the before refilling them. I got fussed at one time bc the caramel was spoiled and there was mild in the rim of the bottle so I dumped all the caramel out and then scrubbed the bottle with soap and scolding hot water. I got fussed at and was told I should have saved the spoiled caramel. We were always out of supplies bc the managers didn't know how to do their job properly. The manager accused one of my very best friends of stealing coffee beans bc she didn't stay on top of keeping the beans ordered!!I know this is supposed to be a Christian establishment but I can tell you this these managers didn't act Christ like at all. They were very two faced and just down right nasty, cruel and they take advantage of ppl especially young teenagers bc that's all that they can really get to work there"

Just north of Concord in sleepy Kannapolis, this Christian based coffee shop is a laptop toting coffee drinker's dream. Huge windows, tons of comfy seating, tables, bar & stool seating, couches, bean bags, arm chairs, sit wherever it feels  right. The environment is laid back and family oriented. Work while your favorite Christian music plays in the background. Each cup has a handwritten phrase like Jesus Loves You on it. The Staff is warm, fast and fun to talk with. Do bring a sweater if you like to be warmer and maybe an extension cord. Food is pastries only - delish! You can bring your own too. Other than that, they have a drive thru window, lots of parking and the  restrooms are very clean."
