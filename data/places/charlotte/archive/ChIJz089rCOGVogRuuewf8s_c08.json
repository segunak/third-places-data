No manager, and I think I had 3 huge pieces of cheese on there. It looked more like a grilled cheese sandwich than anything else. Also, the broccoli cheddar did not taste like it used to.

I've always ordered the same thing for years because of my allergies: the bacon turkey bravo with french baguette instead of the tomato basil bread. The manager (who placed my order) was very nice and even wrapped my pager so there wouldn't be any cross contamination on that either. She made sure the cooks behind the counter knew about my allergies and made me feel like I was in safe hands.\n\nOnly downside I had about the experience was the lack of clean tables. Seemed like all the tables had crumbs on them; however, with how busy they were, it was to be expected."

Everyone on the team today was friendly and kind, but I really wanted to shout out Marcia in particular because I needed someone else to share in one of my happiest moments! I don't have family here to celebrate with and that was what we needed a celebration of love! So thank you so much for making our day special and feeling the joy with us!"

I've mentioned to management that forgetting barbecue sauce on the barbecue chicken sandwich is kind of a key component, and frustrating. They took the feedback and my next sandwich was fine. I recently ordered a steak and cheddar as well as a Greek salad to go after ordering breakfast. They forgot to add cheddar on the steak and cheddar, and yes the meat was skimpy, but I more care that the two ingredients IN THE NAME of the sandwich are included. The dressing cup was also not closed so by the time I got to eat the salad at work later that day everything was soaked. (I had trusted the order was correct and packaged with care, my mistake) I'm used to them regularly forgetting ingredients but they never make up for it or offer to redo it correctly. I hate ordering rapid pick up just have to unbox and unwrap things before I leave just to make sure.  I definitely won't pay for a premium sandwich there again. Sad really. Fortunately there's another Panera a couple miles up the interstate"

She just looked at me and pointed at an order that was not mine \" and said is that yours?\" I said no. She finally moved from behind the counter and asked me for  my name. Which should have done in the first place. Instead of just pointing at a random order and guessing. My order was done  it was just sitting on a shelf for who knows how long . She just handed to me and didn't even apologize to me for my wait. I feel like if I wanted to go inside to get my order I would have done that the first time.  I will never again come to the Rock hill Panera Bread. The hot chocolate was also nasty."
