Asking for an allergy menu isn't weird but when we asked for one the woman taking our order responded \"we don't have that but we do our best.\" We can't just hope that your \"best\" is enough to ensure our little one won't get sick from her food. We'd rather just take our business somewhere else with makes me sad."

The cafe does get pretty busy, but parking is shared with other businesses in the shopping center and was easy to find. If you're looking for a great coffee spot with a welcoming vibe, I definitely recommend stopping by!"

When I questioned her about it, she claimed that she wasn't aware that I was waiting. This is unacceptable.

Reminds me of a place that just learned about electricity back in the early days and is just getting up to speed ...\n\nNot a fan of all the PAID/FAKE reviews either. That's super cringe and disingenuous.\n\nLOCAL GUIDE=PAID/FAKE REVIEW. 98% of them are all local guide reviews.\n\nI'd go back if there was new management and a grand reopening.\n\nHope there's some serious improvement.

I ordered a large Caramel Macchiato and a sausage and egg croissant, and both were absolutely delicious. The Caramel Macchiato was rich and flavorful, perfectly balancing the sweetness of the caramel with the robust coffee taste. The sausage and egg croissant was fresh and savory, with a buttery, flaky croissant that complemented the hearty filling. The ambiance of the coffee shop was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect spot to relax and enjoy my breakfast. I highly recommend Rocky River Coffee for anyone looking for a great coffee and breakfast experience."

The owner Dave replied and told me to take my business elsewhere which I will gladly do. Just because that child is your son doesn't mean he has the right to be behind the counter. You don't know what I look like or what my real name is. So you don't know who it is. Are you going to ban all of your customers?  Responding to Dave again, my profile isn't fake. Grow up, you're a business man. You're so pathetic. Also you don't know who I am. If you do please oh please tell me who I am. I can assure you, you'll be wrong."

Bakery items are displayed in glass to the right of the counter, seating options are moderate, and prices are comparable to other cafes. Coffee for two will probably run you $12-$14 depending on your tip. Selections and taste wise, it's pretty comparable to any other cafe minus a cortado on the menu (missed that). What makes this cafe unique though is in their level of personalization. You can really tell they care about each customer's experience from the friendly conversation to attention to detail. Overall you've got my recommendation Rocky River Coffee!\n\nInsider Tip: If you'd like a more set aside hang out setting try the back room open to customers past the counter and pastry display. It has a few tables set up and is perfect for homework, studying or intimate conversation."

However the speed of service has improved a lot.\nI don't like their super bitter plain coffee BUT they make a very good basic hot latte with milk. What they really excel in is their egg and cheese on a hard Keiser Roll. It's the best in Concord/Harrisburg.\nThey also offer delicious Blue Bell ice cream year round also.\nSeating inside can fill up quickly also.\nParking can be a little tight in their small shared lot."

So, I said something about it. I would rather be wrong and say something than right and not say something. Anyways, he told me he's her father and he's allowed to harass her. My response was it's unprofessional since nobody else knows that he's her father. Just an upset man bothering her the entire time. He had a group of men with him, as they were leaving he passively and in a snarky way told the guys \"she doesn't know how to make specialty drinks\"- as they were walking passed me. So obviously it didn't seem like he was her father, why would a father act like that in her work of place? \"Harass\" her in the appropriate environment. On her break, at home, wherever. He had 3 people behind him as he was at the register and she had to tell him there are people behind him that need to order... just a bit unprofessional and irritating that he would be doing this.... Anyways, this is for management to do and say something about it. I feel bad for the girl. She's doing her best."

However, the last few times I've visited, a few of their younger employees had been lacking in the customer service department. Things such as not greeting customers with a smile or making them feel welcomed, looking unhappy or annoyed to be there, using no manners (you're welcome, thank you, or even a \"sorry for making you wait\"), gossiping to other employees behind the counter, and just really having no sense of self-awareness. I have to believe a lot of this is probably related to immaturity and a lack of training. I get this isn't a 5-star restaurant, but the employees here could definitely do a better job of being more friendly to their customers and acting professional in the workplace."

I came in to get it fixed and they said they didn't have vegetable cream cheese--why wouldn't you tell me that when I ordered??? I asked for a refund and they gave me cash. They couldn't give it on card. When the girls called for someone to help give a refund, she yelled to her and the response was \"what?! I'm busy!\" Classy. Please do NOT go to this place. If you want a real bagel, go to Mike's Bagels. Way better. Which is where I ended up. Never again.\n\nIn response to the owner's tasteless response: It makes sense why the customer service is lacking here--he clearly has zero inkling of what customer service should be. Instead of taking accountability,  he blames the problem on the customer and says there's no way the business would've lasted--news flash: the government had been in business much longer and they're still garbage."

Our drinks were ready and waiting before we even finished paying.  The iced chai was good however, it was pre-made so the options to change the milk didn't exist.  They use skim milk which was okay but I would have preferred almond milk and I heard someone else ask for oat milk.  I suspect if they started allowing the customization then they would definitively sacrifice speed.\n\nMy iced coffee was like a ninja was hidden among ice cubes, launching a full on assault in your mouth when taking a drink.  This is a powerful drink that had the potency of espresso but the flavor of cold brew coffee.  I like it, a lot but it was a very interesting explosion of flavor and intensity.  I feel like I won't sleep for four nights.\n\nThe downside of RRC is the speed of the food preparation.  To their credit, a disclaimer is hung over the pick up section that mentions they are not a fast food restaurant, food is made to order and to be patient.  We ordered two breakfast burritos, one with sausage and one with turkey, a customer behind us ordered a breakfast sandwich then a third customer was told the wait would be 30 minutes for food.  We waited about 15 minutes for our burritos and there was no one in front of us.\n\nThe burritos tasted really good and were nice and fat.  I would not order the turkey burrito again; it was cooked fine but I wasn't a fan of the taste."
