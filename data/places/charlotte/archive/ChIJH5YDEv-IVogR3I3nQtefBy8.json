Waited patiently for  over a half hour and watched every one who ordered after us get their snazzy coffees and leave. After asking politely multiple times and being met with attitude from the young girl behind the counter, we asked for a refund. It took another 10 minutes for the staff to figure out how to issue a refund. We will not be back.\n\n*UPDATE* Called and talked to the manager and he was rather dismissive. He seemed to be familiar with the girl with the attitude problem but essentially told me it was \"in my head\" and \"it just seemed like\" others were being served ahead of us and we had been forgotten. Pretty much solidified me not giving them another chance. I was hoping the call would change that but NOPE."

I've been in here several times lately over the past few months- each time I've been greeted as I've walked in and I've noticed the baristas asking specific questions about how I would like my coffee which as a a coffee addict I appreciate so much. It seems like service has improved since I last left my review. It's hard for local businesses to thrive in this climate and I appreciate their commitment and hard work to excellence, rock hill is lucky to have them!\n\nWe just moved to town not long ago but the first thing I looked at were coffee shops that roasted their own beans so I came upon knowledge perk and have tried it about 7-9 times. Their storefront is gorgeous, the space is beautiful and really a great spot in town- 10/10 for the atmosphere and physical location. However, each time I've been in- no one welcomes you when you arrive and it almost feels like the baristas have been annoyed by my questions or on half of the occasions they've been talking with coworkers while I'm standing there to get my order taken. The to-go service is incredibly fast which is great but  the times I've been in there's been things that were forgotten from my order or sat at the counter for a long time bc I didn't know it was ready. Their drip was incredibly good but the other drinks I've ordered- iced lattes, iced americanos, hot americanos have been lacking I'm not sure if the staff are as trained as you would expect from such a high quality location. I hope great things for this small business and I hope that their baristas grow in knowledge and hospitality."

One of the things I like to do when I move to a new place is find a local coffee house that I can enjoy a good conversation with the staff and have a great place to relax.  The coffee is great.  I had asked what is good.  I was recommended a bourbon latte that is seasonal.  They even were able to do it with oat milk.  It was delivered to me quickly and this has become my favorite for the moment.\n\nThe music and the vibe is just right.  The music is a good selection and it is not obnoxious.  It is loud enough to enjoy but quiet enough for me and my boyfriend to be able to talk and relax.  I like to read legal decisions and I was able to concentrate, which is a plus.  I like that there is Wi-Fi and that it works.\n\nI've read other reviews that people have had to wait to for service.  I've not experienced it in the trips that I've had.  I was instantly greeted and even had a chance for good conversation.  I also appreciate the hours of operation.  I like to have a coffee later in the day and this place was able to deliver.\n\nOne of my all time favorite coffee places!  Thank you on a job well done!  I'll continue to return."

There was a little on street parking in front of the shop but not much.  The other option was the mud pit across the street that screamed \"hold my beer and watch this\".  I think there was some more parking further past the shop but cannot say for sure.\n\nWhen we walked in we were in awe of the inside of this place.  It is one of the largest, private coffee shops I've visited.  Plenty of seating and alot of open space.  I checked in on Yelp, as I always do, and noticed a free latte.  When I showed that to the person taking our order she and the gentleman she called over both said they had never seen it before and didn't know anything about it.  They did say they were going to honor the perk but after pointing out that it required a $15-$20 purchase I opted not to use it.\n\nI ordered a cold brew and a chai latte with almond milk.  Both were served correctly as ordered and quickly.  I noticed the cold brew looked like a dark tea and the taste wasn't that far off from a dark tea either.  I take my cold brew black and usually have to water it down because it's so strong however, this tasted very watered down already.  It tasted like what I've made at home and didn't let brew long enough.  I asked the barista if their cold brew normally looked that light and she just said \"yes\" while walking away.  No concern that I would be asking that question which probably should have raised a red flag.  Next was the chai - equally watered down.  It was pretty much just warmed almond milk.  At this point I just decided it wasn't my day for coffee and let it be."

They also have individual roasters where you can come and roast your own coffee and classes to help you. We were welcomed and given information by Kevin, who is so welcoming and friendly. Just moved to their area; can't wait to make this our regular coffee shop to hang out at.  They normally have live music, but not right now during COVID."

I did not see any employees wash their hands before preparing my food and drink, which is unsanitary and a health code violation. The table I sat at while I waited for my order had a sign labeled \"clean\" but it was clear due to the crumbs all over the table it was in fact not clean. Normally I wouldn't mind as much about a less than stellar table, but we are still in a pandemic so it's a little concerning regular procedures are not being upheld along with extra cleanliness efforts to prohibit the spread of COVID-19. When I received my latte it tasted very burnt, in fact I was almost certain I had been given decaf instead of regular espresso (I am also a barista so I am very familiar with the difference). Either way, it was not very good and I could only stand to drink about 1/4 of the drink before tossing it out. I had high hopes it would be a great place with great coffee since it was a local company with local roasting. I'm sad to say I did not have a great or even good first impression, apart from the decor itself. I'm not sure I'll be back..."

Right now they have a small retail space that is open with limited hours. If you're lucky to catch them when they are open pick up some beans, or a cup of freshly roasted and brewed coffee. You won't be disappointed. Their IPO is the most popular, but they also have great Jamaican and decaf available. The decaf is a nice dark roast, so if you like the taste of good coffee without the caffeine then this is for you. It's not a light, watered down decaf, it actually has taste! Can't wait until they open their larger location."
