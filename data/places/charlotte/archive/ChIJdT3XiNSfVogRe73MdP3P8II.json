The visual presentation of the donuts is impressive. However, I find myself ambivalent regarding their taste; I believe it could have been more robust. I sampled the Chocolate Whoopie Pie, Samoa Cookie, and Milk and Cookies, with the Milk and Cookies emerging as my favorite due to its soft texture and pleasant flavor.\n\nIt is worth noting that parking is available in the garage, and they offer validation for parking tickets. On my visit, I had to circle the block several times to locate a suitable parking garage. While street parking exists, navigating through traffic makes the garage a more convenient option for accessing The Salty. One drawback was the cleanliness of the glass display for the donuts, which could have benefited from a thorough cleaning. Conversely, the quality of the boxes used for the donuts is commendable."

It's quickly become one of my favorite drinks.\n\nI also love that they've expanded their menu to include baked goods--such a great addition to their already amazing variety of donuts. The vibe of the place is cozy and inviting, making it a perfect spot to relax and enjoy some delicious treats.\n\nIf you're a donut lover or just looking for a unique snack, The Salty Donut is a must-visit. I can't wait to come back and try more of their creations! Highly recommend! "

The whipped lemon ricotta bomboloni was creamy with its zesty lemon flavor and smooth ricotta filling. The balance of sweetness and sourish was awesome. The Milk and cookies donut was soft, topped with rich Oreo cookies. The Brown butter and salt cake donut was the most sophisticated flavor for me providing a blend of brown butter and salt. The cookie monster donut offered a luxurious visual aspect with the vibrant blue background and it was amazing. The candied pistachio white chocolate donut was delicious with the crunchy pistachios on top. The vegan cinnamon sugar crumble was flavorful. The gluten free chocolate Whoopie donut was scrumptious. Finally, the Samoa cookie donut was fantastic with a blend of shredded coconut, caramel sauce and chocolate drizzle. However these donuts were on the expensive side and can be considered for one time."

So on the way out, I perused the display and decided that Mrs. K. would be enjoying the Whipped Lemon Ricotta Bombolini. Not cheap at $4.30 but wow, amazing.\n\nYes, I was warned when offered a bite that it had to be a small one so I did so. Strong lemon flavor and just like my Candied Pistachio, perfection.\n\nThe Salty Donut also offers traditional glazed, Samoa Cookie, Cookie Monster and Cragels. They have Vegan and Gluten Free donuts too!\n\nNote that the address is correct but they are on the Camden side of the building. There is two hour street parking in front and they validate up to two hours in the building's parking deck."

You immediately see the sweets on display when you walk in. There are two seating sections to either side. Yet, the waiting area just to the right of the door has the best seating with 3 comfortable chairs.\n\nI ordered the cinnamon cereal milk latte and their seasonal apple crisp cinnabun donut. The latte was not as sweet as I expected, which was good. I wish the cereal steeped syrup had more of a distinct flavor. The donut was pretty good, too. I wish the apple crisp flavor was strong, though. I would try again if in the area."

The place smelled like a lot of cleaning supplies. The employees seemed really disinterested. The Halloween decorations were also not family friendly, kinda over the top but I understand that's a matter of taste. Now I know Saturdays are probably long days for them in busy south end, but they were still set to be open for another hour or more and had a dozen people in the place. The \"vibes\" were basically what I would do if I were in the service industry and wanted everyone to hurry up and get out. Hopefully I can try it again and get a better experience, but I really think right now there are better locally held options for donuts and cafes."

Took another 6 minutes for any of them to come to the ordering counter.\nSecond, we ordered half dozen donut holes and a strawberry shortcake donut.\nThe holes were dry and oddly flavored for original, vanilla.\nThe strawberry shortcake, while heavily filled with strawberry cream, tasted nothing like strawberry,  and was albeit, salty for some strange reason.\nThe whole experience was a bust."

My brother in law got the strawberry and I tasted it and it was dry as well. It had some sort of artificial strawberry flavor if you could even call it that. My husband is now hesitant to try his. I will not be ordering these again. I'm all for local doughnut shops with specialty doughnuts but not these. Dunkin' has \"cake\" type doughnuts and they are even better than these were which is saying a lot because I HATE Dunkin Doughnuts."

The Salty Donut takes the donut and makes it a staple piece.

But if you want something that is complex and delicious that you can enjoy slowly then for sure come to The Salty Donut. A word of advice on how to eat them, do not try and eat an entire donut in one sitting, or else you can have a rush of sugar and it can be overwhelming. Instead cut off pieces of it maybe 1/4 at a time to really enjoy it."

The coffee was really good. The staff spoke as soon as we came through the door. Now, parking can be a beast with limited parking in the front.

It was a great balance of sweet and salty for his lack of sweet tooth. Hope they keep it!\n\nMilk and cookies is SUPER sweet (i have a strong sweet tooth) I enjoy but have to split it among 2 days. Same with the chai, also SUPER delicious but sooo sweet.\nUbe pina colada doughnut texture, taste, and frosting are my favorite. The only part im not a fan of is the filling. Not bad just not for me. Otherwise it would be my ultimate favorite.\nThus the Boston cream doughnut is my #1 choice here. Never know what to get? This creamy, comforting, sweet piece of smooth heaven is the choice!\n\n$5 = 5 star baked goods!\n\nI also enjoy their jasmine tea and my partner enjoyed the peach cobbler iced coffee. Make sure you stir the coffee each time before sipping otherwise just get a strong smoky coffee flavor (not bad just syrup settles)"

I got the Milk & Cookies, Mango Passion Fruit White Chocolate, and a Chocolate Chip Sea Salt.\n\nThe donuts have a unique flavor profile. I can taste the shortening used as it leaves a slight after taste. Also, the brioche seems over proofed as it is a tad bit tough to chew. They are huge, though, so you're definitely getting your money's worth."

I also want to state that the employees are hard working and helpful.\n\nI pick up donuts on my way to my volunteer gig which is early. Most places aren't open, so I was thrilled when Salty Donut opened up and opened early and their stuff was great, so why am I leaving a 2 star rating?\n\nBecause the last three times I have been in early - around 7:10, maybe only one or two donuts are ready, so I leave empty handed and have to scramble for some other places I can go get something for the volunteers. Now, if this were a coffee shop that had donuts, I wouldn't be disappointed. But this a donut shop that has coffee. I'm not trying to be a pain but if you offer donuts and you open at 7am, I should have some expectations that donuts will be available to buy.\n\nAs I stated, employees are working hard and what they produce is really good-especially the donut holes, so it's not people being slack. I'm not sure what the timing issue is, but if most donuts can't be ready at 7 when you open, maybe opening at 7 won't work. I'll be sad, but it beats being frustrated. I can't be told to come back in 30-45 minutes to pick up donuts that I need now, and again, if donuts won't be ready until 7:45 why open at 7. Maybe its just for the coffee, but I get coffee there because I am getting donuts.\n\nAnyway, the donuts and employees are great, the timing is just an issue. I'll keep recommending you all, but only if people are going after 8am. I'd love to return because volunteers love the donuts, but I can't keep going and leaving with nothing. Thank you for listening to this issue."

The difference came in the form of a invitation and gift card to return an allow them to demonstrate their normal customer experience - proof is in the experience and we will return to fairly allow them to show their commitment. Stay tuned for my update from that experience. I am very hope forklift\n\nDisappointed with the experience! The brewed coffee was not hot enough and the order was screwed up. The most difficult thing to accept is that it was not very crowded. Donuts we did get were tasty but they vomited the one that I really wanted which completely screwed up the whole experience. Don't think I will be returning because of that experience - spent more than $60 for the disappointment!"

We read some of the not so great ones as well, but decided to give them a try anyway because the great reviews outweigh the bad ones. Well, should've listened to the not so great ones. These were so disappointing. The presentation of the donuts and the cute box they come in is so misleading. The donut itself (the plain parts with no icing) taste like bland bread. I didn't realize until after reading the owner's response that the donuts were brioche, well... they taste like it. I couldn't get past the texture of the donut to enjoy it as a whole. My sister and I both tried the Strawberry Shortcake one and the Original and wasn't impressed. We both stated the Strawberry one left an aftertaste. With each donut at roughly $4, I really wanted to return them and get my money back as we literally tried a piece of all of them thinking it would get better. I threw $20 of bread away. Not sure how this place received so many great reviews. I would say visit to see if it's just my tastebuds. I'll stick to MJ's Donuts in Pineville or MoMo's donuts in Rock Hill as they're more of to the donut I'm used to."

The strawberry shortcake donut was lacking strawberry flavor and the banana cream was ok as far as flavor but again just to bready, not giving donut (light and airy) vibes."
