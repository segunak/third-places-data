Breakfast and lunches, gluten-free options and a wide variety of flavors for coffees and tea, as well as lactose-free options \n\nWhen you arrive you feel very welcome, how to get to your grandmother's house and all those who take care of you are super kind and sweet \n\nThere are a variety of tables and seats for you to choose to your liking and even a more private section if you need to study, work or recharge social battery ; you order at the front, they give you a little number and they bring your food to the table, the drinks are delivered to you in a window by your name  each table and their seats are different, it is a concept that I loved to die \n\nYou can see that they are very eco-friendly in the way they serve food and drinks in biodegradable containers and/or reusable dishes and cutlery, seeing places that strive for the environment always makes me happy \n\nI read that they offer courses to eat better or the space for private events/meetings after working hours \n\nAnd I didn't pay much attention to it, but they have a small stand with books or notebooks and nice things like that \n\nAlso there are super beautiful green areas all around and a lake with ducks and geese so If you prefer not to sit, you can take a walk with your drink around nature \n\nEverything is definitely excellent, the flavors, the attention, the decoration, the prices, around areas, this should be anybody frequent cafe "

Very much a hidden gem. 4 stars because the speed could be a tad faster and I got the sense the young lady taking orders was new, but we've all been there, so it's understandable."

I decided to try their cold brew coffee with oat milk, complemented by toasted marshmallow syrup. While the initial taste was pleasant, I found it slightly lacking in sweetness. However, the barista kindly accommodated my request for more sweetness, which made it thoroughly delightful. The ambiance exuded an eclectic and cozy country vibe. The blueberry muffin I savored was not excessively sugary, and its delectable flavor left me uncertain whether it was homemade. All in all, it was a wonderfully laid-back and enjoyable experience, filled with fun and relaxation."

They taste like the beans were over roasted and or there was not enough coffee flavor kind of like water down or day-old leftover coffee. So I went back inside to try to see what the resolution could be. She re-made the drinks of course using all of the same ingredients so in the end they all came out the same. So I don't recommend if you're a real coffee person I don't recommend chatty Cathy's on Causeway in Fort Mill South Carolina. There was no resolution other than just remaking the drinks. She got the $15 sale but I'm sharing my priceless experience. EPIC FAIL"

The young lady that took my order wanted to be absolutely certain that all I wanted was a plain cap, which I'm used to now, so it was fine. lol\n\nThe cap was pretty good. Good espresso shot and the right amount of steamed milk. My wife thought that the smoothie was not so great. Sorta like chewing on oatmeal, but we chalked it up to the healthy side of things at the counter.\n\nThe only problem was that service was profoundly slow after the order was placed. I don't know how many pending orders were placed when we arrived, but in the nearly 15 minutes we waited I only saw one drink arrive at the window. I was by no means in a hurry, but that's a long time. They also didn't announce when the smoothie was up, I just happened to see it sitting there when my drink was ready and asked if it was ours.\n\nIf we lived closer I'd be inclined to try this coffee shop in the future, but their hours combined with our schedule means there just won't be an easy enough opportunity to try to make it back."

Minimal bitterness, good mouth feel and not too sweet for it being flavored which was great. The food menu is where this place lacks but there's still solid choices. It's limited on sandwiches and what I ordered was good, I just would like more options to chose from but I understand it's a small shop.

The barista was not very friendly but hey - she made a good cup of Joe!\n\nI love the rustic feel of the building and there are seating options.  I look forward to visiting again.

The log cabin feel on the inside was homey and quaint. I got a shot of espresso, which was delicious and my cup of regular drip was well brewed also. The personnel were friendly and accommodating. The place was busy during our visit with people in and out but the staff was great to follow covid-19 precautions and kept everything disinfected and clean. All in all great visit and we will definitely be back!"
