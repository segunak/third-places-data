It feels super cozy, and there are lots of spots to sit, whether you're meeting up with a friend or trying to get some work done.\n\nThat said, the food takes forever. I waited 15 minutes for just one empanada, and it wasn't even that busy. It's not the first time either, so just keep that in mind if you're in a hurry.\n\nAlso, the WiFi hasn't worked either time I've been here, which is a bummer if you're hoping to get stuff done.\n\nGreat vibes overall, but definitely not the place if you're short on time or need reliable internet."

I would say this place is just a hype, yes nice decor and atmosphere overall but the customer service should be better!"

That being said i came here to try this place specifically for the outside patio, which i was very dissapointed in and may be the foundation of this review. The outside area is on the perfect side of the building and has amazinf outdoor furniture and space, that being said none of the egg chairs or patio chairs had cushions making them super uncomfortable to sit in. We found a nice table and chairs out there anyways and went to put up the umbrellas as they were down and we planned to do laptop work and needed a bit of shade on the screens. Let me note that there was no note, no signage, no indication of anything wrong here, i just had simply thought someone had put them down to enjoy the sunlight( i sure was) but much to my suprise the umbrella was super broken, and a string was hanging. No big deal really it was dissapointing but not the end of the world. What made it bad was the man that slowly came out of the building to barrade us about trying to put it up and being rude , we simply stated we didnt know it was broken , he didnt say anything further, but actually walked to another table that was out to tie a rope around it and the really sweet ladies also asked him if their umbrella was out of order, he stated \" yes and no matter how many times we tie them up customers take them down\" she mentioned maybe putting a sign up. to which he stated, that if they would just not touch it there would be no problem, the ladies were appalled and actually left, we moved inside after the interaction of the rude employee. The man had long hair about shoulder length, a 5 oclock shadow, and a mustach that connected to chin hair, he was wearing a beige hat and button up. Looked to be early 30s late 20s. Managment should really have a talk with him. If he hates the public and his job this much this is not the environment for him. The good in the review was the raspberry sweet tea and the amount of plugs. I would also like to mention maybe getting some back rest cusions on the benches. i did enjoy the sliding butt cushions though. Would give another try but if i walked into this employee again i would leave again. He was very offputting and seemed hostile."

I told my husband to just get on the interstate we have a long way to drive. Thankfully he said, \"Let's just go.\"\n\nSUMAQ was extremely busy on a Sunday morning. The three folks working the register and coffee station were absolute pros. They have a very efficient system; so if you walk in, see a long line, and think about leaving. DO NOT. The line moved quickly and we received our coffee quickly. The food took a bit longer, but it was absolutely worth it. The atmosphere was warm, bright, and inviting. This is definitely a great spot to meet family or friends to chat and eat good food.\n\nWhen I order a cortado the first thing I notice is the size of the cup it comes in. A cortado is a 1:1 ratio of espresso and steam milk; so when I was handed a petite coffee mug excitement and anticipation rose up in me. I quickly took a few photos then a sip of the cortado. The texture was not as velvety as I would have liked, but the flavor of the espresso was excellent. I immediately grabbed my husband's dirty chai to taste it. Delicious. Whatever coffee bean SUMAQ is using and the method they are using to brew is magical.\n\nSUMAQ was absolutely worth detour!\n\nEnjoying life one cortado at a time."

There was a slight language barrier with the woman taking our order, when asking to make sure there isn't any cross contamination with the foods. Most places accommodate his allergies by leaving a note with the chef, but she refused to ask. She immediately said no. After I asked to speak to the chef, he came out and dryly said everything is prepared on the same surface followed by a careless shrug. It was disappointing that wiping down a counter top and just taking extra precaution for a customer was too much. If that'd be too much we'd completely understand but the lack of warmth and the low tolerance for a short discussion with eager customers was frustrating.\nDespite how much I wanted to try this place I felt that I'd rather spend my money in a place that's more polite and communicative with their customers. Hoping they can improve customer service moving forward."

We got their chocolate dulce de leche cake and it was super delicious and almost like a mix of a cake tree leches cake. Their empanadas were super delicious as well and the ham and cheese bread was amazing.\n\nTheir Sumaq latte was amazing but what stole the show was the dulce de leche latte, that has to be one of my favorite lattes I've ever had. Not overly sweet but you can really taste that dulce de leche taste. An absolute gem and would rate it a 10/10 spot."

I must be inflation because every coffee shop I have been to in the country it is same. But it was still delicious. Coming here was a very relaxing experience."

            "review_text": "Nestled on the bustling 6259 South Boulevard in Charlotte, NC, SUMAQ Coffee & Catering is a hidden gem that delights the senses from the moment you step through its doors. This review can't fully capture the enchanting experience, but I'll do my best to convey the magic that awaits you at this incredible venue. With an exquisite blend of artisanal coffee, delightful pastries, and exceptional service, SUMAQ stands out as a beacon of culinary artistry and warm hospitality.\n\nAtmosphere & Design: A Contemporary Sanctuary\n\nSUMAQ's exterior is unassuming yet modern, welcoming visitors into a space that feels both contemporary and cozy. The moment you walk in, you're greeted by a minimalist yet chic interior, with a tasteful combination of wooden furnishings, industrial accents, and soft lighting that creates a serene and inviting atmosphere. The outdoor patio is an oasis in itself, perfect for a sunny day or a tranquil evening under the stars. The design seamlessly blends comfort with style, making it an ideal spot for everything from a quiet morning coffee to a leisurely afternoon catch-up with friends.\n\nCulinary Delights: A Feast for the Senses\n\nThe menu at SUMAQ is a curated selection of culinary delights that showcase a fusion of traditional and innovative flavors. The first thing that caught my eye was the signature iced matcha latte, beautifully layered in a mason jar. The vibrant green matcha contrasted elegantly with the creamy milk, creating a visual treat that was only surpassed by its taste. The matcha was of the highest quality, offering a rich, umami flavor balanced perfectly by the sweetness of the milk. It was a harmonious blend that was both refreshing and indulgent.\n\nNot to be outdone, the iced coffee was equally impressive. Served in a similar mason jar, the coffee had a deep, robust flavor with subtle notes of chocolate and caramel. It was the perfect companion to the delicious pastries I tried next. The flan was a masterpiece, with a silky, smooth texture that melted in your mouth. Topped with a single, vibrant raspberry, it was not just a dessert but a work of art. The caramel sauce was just the right amount of sweet, providing a delightful contrast to the creamy custard.\n\nThe alfajor, a traditional South American delight, was another highlight. This delicate pastry, filled with luscious dulce de leche and dusted with powdered sugar, was a bite-sized piece of heaven. It offered a perfect balance of sweetness and texture, with the buttery, crumbly cookie surrounding a rich, caramel-like filling. It's a treat that evokes the warm, comforting flavors of Latin America, making you feel right at home.\n\nService: A Touch of Excellence\n\nThe service at SUMAQ is in a league of its own, largely thanks to the charismatic and attentive Juan Pablo. His passion for the cafe and its offerings is evident in every interaction. Juan Pablo's knowledge of the menu and his genuine enthusiasm make every visit special. He has an uncanny ability to make you feel like the most important guest in the room, offering personalized recommendations and ensuring that every aspect of your experience is perfect. It's rare to find such a combination of professionalism and warmth, and it's clear that Juan Pablo and the entire team at SUMAQ take great pride in their work.\n\nA Perfect Conclusion\n\nSUMAQ Coffee & Catering is more than just a cafe; it's a destination that promises an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a local looking for your new favorite spot or a visitor exploring the culinary scene of Charlotte, SUMAQ offers something truly special. The thoughtful design, exceptional food and beverages, and unparalleled service come together to create an experience that's both sophisticated and heartfelt. I left SUMAQ not only satisfied but inspired, eagerly anticipating my next visit. Thank you, Juan Pablo, and the wonderful team at SUMAQ, for crafting such a memorable experience. This is a five-star gem that deserves every bit of its acclaim!"

We recommend their Sumaq latte.  I was very impressed that the owner remembers us and what we drink and genuinely takes an interest.

            "review_text": "I literally walked into Sumaq TODAY and was not in there more than 5 minutes before walking out.  The decor and seating was nice enough but I was very disappointed (after hyping them up based on reviews I'd read to my daughters).  We were not there long enough to be greeted by anyone which was not an issue.  The REAL problem was that there were gnats swarming around the food (lots of them) and noone seemed to be concerned to attempt to cover the food.  Also, I was disappointed to see that the food displayed did not look appealing.  I was VERY disappointed that the carrot cake they are charging $7 plus for looked like a \"carrot cake\" made in a sheet pant and cut into smaller squares.  They were not layered as advertised on their photos online.  They were literally squares cut from a larger sheet cake.  I am a baker, so I know quality baked goods when I see them and the carrot cake was not it.  There were other baked items where the gnats were that looked burned on the top.  It was very disappointing to see this, as I was so excited about our first (and last trip) to this shop.\n\nIn fairness, we were not there long enough to be greeted and the location was very crowded, so sitting was not an option as well. The furniture looked attractive enough in appearance but that was it for the atmosphere. The online photos and videos are much more appealing than what we saw.\n\nI hope this review will ignite some change in this business's standards, as our first visit was very disappointing as compared to the expectations.  Good luck to them, I know running a business is not an easy task but there are some changes needed.\n\nGodspeed Sumaq!"

The ham and cheese reminded me more of a doughy stromboli versus an empanada but I still enjoyed it. This may have just been a miscommunication though since I don't think they meant to say this was an empanada. However, I would love to try their empanadas sometime! Unfortunately, they were just out of them when I had visited. Lastly, that alfajores which was a divine little cookie. The shortbread cookie was perfect and the dulce de leche filling was tasty. They have indoor and outdoor seating and additional parking in the back. It was also getting quite busy after I sat down so it seems to be a popular spot in the area too."

Husband's cold brew was watered down and no cream.\n\nSumaq seems to be the kind of place that really wants to look like a cute coffee shop with its fake plants, cheap furniture, and store bought pastries, but without the concentration on the quality of product, the facade is obvious."

Plenty of seating, of many varieties both indoor and outdoor.\n\nThe food and drink options are unique, especially so the food. Lots of great options for fuller meals, like freshly made sandwiches, wraps, waffles etc. As well as an assortment of delicious pastries.\n\nI got one of the sandwiches and their seasonal pumpkin latte. The latte took about 5 mins to prepare and the food about 15. Both were delicious, the only mention I'd have in regard to being un-positive is that the pumpkin coffee didn't really taste like pumpkin, just more like a seasonal spiced latte. But it was still delicious.\n\nReally recommend this spot, they also have outlets and Wi-Fi it's a great coffee spot to get some work done in if you want to be out :)"

You can come for breakfast to have a pastry or empanada with your coffee. For lunch or dinner, I strongly suggest the Wasi House sandwich. It is shredded chicken, bacon, caramelized pineapples, cheese and pepper sauce. If the person preparing it toasts the middle of the sandwich at the cut, the crispness adds another layer of texture and flavor. This time someone did not do it, but the sandwich is still one of the only ones I fawn over in Charlotte.\n\nNow that Sumaq latte is a whole vibe. You can get a cinnamon latte almost anywhere, but I promise you that this one tastes like REAL cinnamon and not a flavored syrupy mess. It is the perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and bitter. I was suggested this the first time I came and can't move myself to try anything else. If they have chica morada, Peruvian purple corn drink, do order it. I like to order it with no ice to take home where I add tequila or dark rum. It is perfectly fine as is, but this cocktail takes greatness to perfection for me.\n\nThe interior? See the video I posted. The outdoor area transports you to Peru though you are perched directly on South Blvd. If you can tune out the traffic, you can enter bliss.\n\nBig thumbs up to the stools that a disabled plus size vertically challenged woman to sit with ease. This is a rarity at establishments."
