Since my friend and I are lightweights, we stuck with a matcha latte and a chai latte instead.\n\nThe matcha was subtle but had a bit more flavor than most places. They've got all sorts of seating options - big tables, small ones - so it seems like a chill spot to hang out when it's not busy.\n\nKinda bummed we couldn't try the cocktails, but it was still a nice break. Might have to come back when we've got more time to kill!"

Before we get into the coffee and danish, let me say that I was really digging the design and vibe of this place. They managed to accomplish a more classy and intimate setting, but at the same time it was also laid back and easy going. I found this to be a unique combination of atmospheres for a coffee shop. Although, they do have wine and a good whiskey selection so that may be why there is an overlap in the settings that I was experiencing. I also appreciated the no laptops on the weekends concept that they have implemented. Even though I didn't find myself chatting with any locals, which is what they stated the goal of this concept is, I think it's a great idea! I find that we too often bury ourselves into technology and forget to experience the things around us. It's a step in the right direction, and a good way to increase the interactions among others. Now, back to the coffee and danish. The creme brulee latte was spot on and the danish was exactly what I needed to get my morning started. I liked the location of this place, and I definitely see The Hobbyist being one of my go to coffee shops!"

Whether it's the cashier telling us there was \"no way to know\" whether a pastry was vegetarian or not, being scolded for having our dog on a leash while we ordered only to see the same manager petting a dog in line the next time we were there or waiting 10 minutes for a cold pastry to be placed in a bag it's always some completely avoidable example of poor service. My breaking point to leave this review was being charged 45 cents for water (which I had to fill myself) after we paid $19 for two coffees and one pastry. I get it. Cups cost money. And our service was very friendly (and apologetic) this time. I've never left a Google review before but please make some changes, The Hobbyist."

I spent a lot of money here and left good tips, but I am not coming back again because I don't like spending money at a place I feel hated.  I personally don't like their \"unplugged\" policy, as well the fact that different staff enforce it differently.\n\nPersonally, I understand if the bar is crowded to not have someone sitting around not buying anything.  But, if you are there buying drinks and there is nobody around (like how it was when I was there) it makes no sense to tell people not to sit there.   As someone with herniated discs its not easy to find adequate high chair seating in the place either.   And , to be honest, I have never been to any bar or coffeeshop around town who forbids me from using my e-reader at the bar, which is ridiculous in itself.\n\nI was really liking this place and most of the baristas are real nice, but it takes one bad apple to chase you out of the place.  Also, they need to rethink their policy of keeping people away from the bar area."

It had a fresh spiced flavor and was pretty sweet - as though they melted a gingerbread cookie into a beverage. Not only that, the vibes are cozy, classy, and very chic. The barista who served our drinks also had a lovely personality: they were friendly and very funny! Now whenever someone asks where I can find the best Chai, I will immediately say The Hobbyist!!!"

She didn't ask me if I needed assistance nor did she give me the to-go cup I requested when I purchased a chai tea.\nAnyways, things got progressively better when the young African American woman entered. She was more polite and asked if I needed anything, and was pleasant to be around as I sat and worked on my laptop. Soon the first girl left and it was even better when the three gentlemen entered. Had the best tasting Caramel Macchiato, and the customer service was much better from them. The experience got better and plus the shop doubles as a brewery too! So that was pretty cool! It's a good place to go within the area when out on a date or visiting the NoDa area."

At the time, my initial thinking was that the establishment did not want computers on the furniture (because the alternative, banning them completely, seemed absured given that I regularly worked at The Hobbyist this summer. Shortly after getting my tea did one of the employees let me know about their new \"unplug policy\" on the weekends to give patrons a chance to connect with one another in person (although, when I looked around, the policy didn't seem to be efficacious). On the weekends, I sometimes need to get out of the house and complete work in a neutral space with other people who are similar in that regard, but I feel that this recent policy overplays its hand and falls short of the intended goals. Restricting patron's autonomy and choice in the entire space detracts from the neutrality of what I feel a coffee shop represents."

They have an understanding of their espresso pulls and the art of making a drink to give you a beautifully presented beverage with the right flavor as well. I had a few of their selection. The chai latte is exactly what a chai latte should be. It didn't taste overly sweet like many do and the different spices and herbs of the chai were present and clear. Their espresso was also wonderful. I'm not usually someone who enjoys just straight espresso but I suppose I do when it is done right. The Hobbyist does it right. The live band in the background also helped add to the experience. Very pleased."

Its hard to use this coffee shop like a coffee shop when you cant talk to the person next to you or study. Additionally, they have a big garage door in the front, which they keep open way too much, when its very hot and very cold. The owners don't give the workers the authority to close it, even when the weather is terrible.\n\nReply: Thank you for your reply... wasn't looking for PR response though... Just letting the general public know what the shop is like. The back area consists of a couch and 3 chairs, when there's a band or the doors are open, those get filled VERY quickly. I've asked about the windows, and been told that the owner watches the employees over the video camera's, and makes them keep the doors open even when they and/or customers want them closed."

It was truly a grand example of what third wave coffee should be! I ordered one of their signature lattes (Toasted Sage & Fig) it was spot on. The flavors blended perfectly with the espresso!\n\nThey have pastries delivered from a local bakery down the street too (which I think is amazing since they don't have a kitchen in house)\n\nThe atmosphere is stunning. You can tell that whoever designed the space carefully curated the antiques and plants with intention! They have plenty of seating but from what I could see it was filling up fast.\n\nThis is now my new favorite specialty coffee spot in Charlotte! Way to go Hobbyist!!!!!"
