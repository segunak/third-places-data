Stepping in from the cold North Carolina weather, I was immediately welcomed by his warm, genuine hospitality. His passion for matcha is evident in every aspect of the experience.\n\nThe matcha latte I ordered was absolutely perfect - expertly crafted with precise attention to temperature and technique. The rich, complex flavors were beautifully balanced, creating a comforting and luxurious drink that exceeded all expectations.\n\nWhat truly sets this place apart is Eric's dedication to customer service. His knowledge and enthusiasm for matcha is contagious, and he takes the time to ensure each customer has an exceptional experience. His friendly demeanor and attention to detail make visiting Gotcha Matcha feel less like a transaction and more like being welcomed into someone's home.\n\nIf you're seeking the perfect matcha experience in North Carolina, look no further. Eric has mastered both the art of matcha preparation and the art of hospitality. This is more than just a tea shop - it's a destination for anyone who appreciates quality, craftsmanship, and genuine care.\n- Kayla Kaull"

The quality is unmatched, and the staff is always consistent and friendly. They even make the effort to remember returning customers, which makes the experience that much better.\n\nOh, and if they have it, do yourself a favor and try the red velvet cookie--it will literally change your life!

Staff and service was nice and they seem like lovely people. The interior was very chic and reminded me a hotel lobby or bar area.\n\nNow onto the drink. I got the iced gotcha matcha latte which is just a regular matcha latte. All their drinks automatically come with oat milk but they have other alternatives like soy, macadamia, coconut, etc. Being completely honest, the matcha flavor was not very present, it mostly tasted like oat milk with a very small splash of matcha. Color wise, it was a very faint green color and when I received my drink, I could already tell it wasn't going to be as strong as other matcha lattes that I've had. I've been going to Matcha Maiko Cafe and they have a more distinct matcha flavor.\n\nPersonally I think this place is great for those who are new to matcha and want to try a caffeine alternative other than coffee. It wasn't my cup of tea but could be yours!"
