It was delicious with just enough caramel and brownie synergy to make the perfect dessert. I also tried the Marie Antoinette tart. They were delicate and tasteful and had a nice fresh raspberry compote on top. Then I tried the brownie cheesecake tart. This was my favorite one as I'm a sucker for brownies. I tried the Cafe Marcotter, which was heavy and filling, I only had half of the cup because of this. The taste was lovely with the French Vanilla. Finally, I had the Sundried Tomato Turkey Wrap which I felt could have been left off. It was something I could easily make at home, so it was nothing special.\n\nOverall, I give this place a solid A+ for being so damn good!"

I've also noticed an off-putting smell on a couple of visits, though thankfully, that hasn't been an issue recently. Still, the atmosphere is really cute, and it's a nice spot to grab a sweet treat."

If Alice in Wonderland had a baby with France, this would be the marvelous offspring!  Overstimulating, over the top, and a lot of Napoleon reference--I had no idea I needed this in my life.  This location is where delight lives and IT STAYS UP LATE!  This feels perfect for families, dates, visitors to Charlotte, treating yourself for any reason....I would pay to take a tour inside the mind of whoever is responsible for the whimsical &playful aesthetic of this cafe.  We waited approximately 15-20 minutes last Friday evening [Valentines' day] and I have to state this: I am from NY originally, am impatient and have NEVER wished a line would move slowly.  I guarantee I would have waited [HAPPILY] another 15 minutes to absorb the joy of this space!  The ONLY reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did not taste the food, just desserts: macarons, chocolate raspberry tart, almond cake.  I am flying back to Charlotte in April and am counting down to the hour I can immerse myself again in Amelie's."

It's the kind of place where you could linger with a book or chat with friends over cappuccinos in style.\n\nThe staff interaction occasionally felt curt, almost as though they were eager to move things along. While efficient, a warmer, more welcoming touch would elevate the experience significantly.\n\nDespite the service hiccup, Amelie's remains a gem for food lovers seeking an authentic taste of France in a beautiful setting."

However, let me share a little secret: you must try the creme brulee first or on its own. It's incredibly smooth with a perfectly caramelized top, but if you sample it after eating other pastries, you might find the flavor slightly leaning toward egginess. It's as if the richer, buttery treats mask its delicate charm.\n\nWhether you're stopping by for a midday treat or a box of goodies to share, this bakery is a must-visit for pastry lovers."

When she called a name that sounded like mine, I inquired as to whether she called my name and our drink orders but still couldn't understand her. Ultimately, I realized she was referring to my drinks. She rudely slammed my drink on the counter and made an offhand comment about me to a couple standing by waiting for their drink orders. When I asked to speak with the manager, a teenager unfortunately returned who was the manager. I explained my experience but the \"manager\" was dismissive of the encounter. Up until this encounter, my experience at Amelie's was ok, but now I won't be returning. As a person who's lived in Paris, France, the cuisine is far from French. My experience with the idiotic barista and immature manager felt racialized. Black patrons beware!"

He was super excited and told the guy at the counter that it was first time in.\nThe guy responded, and I quote,  \"That means *nothing* to me.\"\nWhen I made small talk about loving the former location, he went on a very angry tirade about how terrible the hours were  and said directly to me - as if I had any input in, or control over this at all - that employees deserve outside lives too.\nWell, of course they do. But yelling at two people who just want a croissant ain't gonna help anything.\n\nWe just left.\nI had also just come in after learning that a friend had passed, so being screamed at by a stranger was especially awful.\n\nOrdinary bland pastries and pissed off employees ?\nNever again."

It's been such a long time since I visited that I did not realize they are in a new location. The new  to me location still gives me the same energy as when I visited years ago. The quirkiness of the decor really makes this place special.\n\nWe arrived fairly late- maybe 30 minutes prior to closing. However, we were still able to order everything we wanted. Additionally, the staff still had great attitudes!\n\nOverall I love everything about Amelie's, the decor, the staff and most importantly the food and drinks. If you have a chance to check this spot out, I highly recommend. You do so!"

They have two sizes of bowl one holds the exact same volume as the only size cup they have.  We actually tested it by filling the cup with water and pouring it in the bowl it's the same. Which is also cheating.  My daughter loves to get dressed up and go to Cafe however the ambiance here come best be described as where culture and civility go to die.  So, we've given up on Amelia's this will be our last visit.  I would love to see a more honest and authentic establishment here."

The strawberry danish had super fresh strawberries and was drizzled in honey. The cream cheese on both was beautifully rich & the pastry was fluffy with the perfect amount of crisp on the edges.\n\nThe macaroon flavors we got were (from top to bottom, left to right): Lavender Lemon, Cafe au lait, Cookie Dough, RE&B (proceeds toward the Hurricane Helene Fund), PB&J, and Coconut Lime. We weren't sure of the flavor of the Red, White, & Blue but it reminded of us crunch berries! Super tasty.\n\nCan't wait to try other items on my next visit!"

During my recent visit, I treated myself to their creme brulee and fruit tart, and let me tell you, they were both out of this world. The creme brulee had the perfect caramelized top, giving way to a luscious, velvety custard underneath. And the fruit tart? It was a masterpiece with its buttery, flaky crust and a colorful array of fresh fruits that provided a delightful contrast to the creamy filling.\n\nAnd let's not forget about their coffee - it's the perfect companion to their desserts, with its rich flavor balancing out the sweetness. Yes, the location might be a bit tricky to find, but trust me, the search is totally worth it. Whenever I'm in Charlotte, Amelie's is a non-negotiable stop for me. The consistently top-notch treats and the cozy atmosphere make it an absolute must-visit!"

The place gives a fancy vibe yet simple enough to feel comfortable instantly. The desserts have a good variety and will definitely want to keep going back to try more/all of it... Also, they have very good vegetarian options for meals - which is a huge plus. Definitely a recommended spot if you are in town...

Bright and early at 7 AM I went there to get something to eat.  Immediately, it seemed as though young girl with the ponytail this morning, 7 AM, was not very happy that I didn't know exactly what I wanted, immediately. More importantly, when I received my order, which was the blueberry muffin that was warmed.  The same girl young girl with the ponytail, took the item out of the oven, put it in plastic container, walked toward the cashier and....just held her hand out. I repeat, Just held her hand out. My son and I was standing away from the front counter, about 3 meters. She said nothing. My son whom I didn't get to stop in time, walked over to her to get it. Which, of course, she said nothing. Not thank you, not Have a nice day. Nothing.\nMy son took the plastic container from her hand and, picked up the other plastic container on the counter.  Once we were on our way, he realized it was not the right order.  So, sometime this morning Amelie's must have realized a French Toast order was not received. Whose fault is that? The young girl with the ponytail from the 7am shift this morning.\nWe all have days we're tired or such. However, Customer Service  is of most importance. I'm not sure what excuse Ms. Young Lady has, but I do hope I will not experience this anymore. Amelie's has always been a fav of mine."

Wow, we had to try it.\n\nGood stuff:\nAtmosphere was amazing! Had a fun play on French art and history. Really bright and colorful.\nCranberry chicken salad sandwich on a croissant was great!\n\nLess Cool Items:\nRegular croissants are not cooked long enough. They are buttery and big, but lack a golden flaky crust that really defines a croissant. Great for a sandwich but not to eat alone.\nThe quiche was burnt on the bottom and way over salted in the middle. Couldn't eat the crust (pictured)\nThe French toast description looked divine... but the brioche was dry and sliced ultra thin; not what anyone would want in a luscious bite of French toast. Also, the syrup was fridge cold. (Pictured)\nThe pastries were meh, kind of like day old baked goods with lots of sugar.\nWe bought six macaroons to give away to friends back home because they were beautiful. After eating one, they were very chewy and overly sweet. The remaining five stayed in our fridge for a few days before being tossed out untouched.\n\nOverall it was disappointing. I was amazed at the large crowds while simultaneously sad that they haven't experienced a true quaint cafe and bakery found on just about every street corner in Paris. I wish them continued success and hope they work on tweaking their recipe's."

This was a completely different tone from the first 2 times I visited this place. I'm really disappointed and probably won't return. Waiting 30 minutes for the food or more is completely unacceptable.  My friend ended up trying to wave someone over to ask if that was her drink just sitting in the counter for the last 20 minutes and instant of bringing it over to the table the lazy young lady just spoke to us, the consumers, from across the counter that you have to come get it. Are you serious right now? Absurd! We didn't have to do that the last time we were there.  We even ordered at a different  end of the counter on this visit. I was really impressed with this small Cafe the first couple of times I went. This third visit made me hate that I spent my hard earned money on subpar service and food, for people who can't bother to get my order correct or to make sure their patrons are taken care of. That's why it took me so long to do the review because I get so pissed everytime I think about it.

Like other Amelie's locations, they are mostly well known for their pastries and coffee, but I went with a friend to sample their other menu items.\nI ordered a wrap, and she, the French onion dip(officially, some kind of toasted beef sandwich with melted cheese that you dunk in the bowl of French onion). Both were incredibly hot and fresh. It was delivered to our table in a timely manner, and it tasted pretty consistent with other locations.\nNot too expensive, and the decorations were fun and lighthearted. I attached images about the surrounding visuals just so you can get a better sense of the atmosphere. I give it top marks for a chill afternoon rendezvous.\nWhen we arrived it was already black dark out, but the place was still fairly packed. I figure they must be doing something right. Not exactly my scene, but I completely get it. We were there for about 3 hours talking, and the staff didn't bother us at all.\nI wouldn't recommend it if you're looking to study, or write over your coffee. It was much too loud for that. Many parents brought crying children, and they seemed almost encouraged to let them run around at a breakneck pace. Don't come if you expect relaxation. It's more like a tiki bar, or a mall terminal. Teens and young adults are heavily encouraged to visit.\n4/5 is fair."

            "review_text": "Hello Viewers,\n\nBefore I departed from Charlotte from my last day of the business, I was browsing around and see if there are any local Cafe, and I decided to go Amelie French bakery & cafe for my last stop.  This is my second french bakery shop for my breakfast.  I am guessing Charlotte has a lot of French influence?  my requirement is simple, as long as cafe provides specious work/relax environment, variety of the foods, and ok internet connection, they are my go-to cafe, and this Amelie's French bakery & cafe is definitely one of them.  (I did not go to another one, so I can't be sure the others)\n\nFrench bakery shop is known for their sweet tooth bakery, and they offer any possible pastry that you can think of.  on the top, the shop also offer breakfast sandwich, lunch style food offer the  customers from the whole journey from savory to sweet, cold to hot.  I order Monte Cristo with cappuccino and ending with petite pecan tart, they are freshly made and delicious to eat.   this cafe is spacious I estimate can fit around 50 people comfortably, in fact the place is too big the store decoration is a bit eccentric that they put everything French related into the decoration.   I guess it's the French style that everything needs to be add to the flourish \n\nin summary, if you visiting Charlotte town, please be sure to spend around 3 hours to visit Amelie's cafe to enjoy the delicious foods, comfortable seating, and kind staff.\n\nP.S - did I mention their internet Is fast?   \n\nPaul"

After struggling with some things in my personal life, I chose to come here for a mid-day escape. Immediately upon entering, I was greeted with the biggest, most genuine smiles. The sweet lady with the blue hair was not only so professional but also welcoming. The gentleman with the glasses at the register was beyond kind and seemed to have the attitude of someone who strives to make everyones day better in anyway he can. Even down to the person who brought out my food, so much care was had for me as someone who just simply ordered a sandwich. I can't express the impact this experience had on me. It brought me to tears at my table. You never know what someone is going through and how massive such a simple interaction can mean to them. I would love for everyone who manages or has any higher position with Amelies to know that these three individuals not only changed my day but also left a massive impact on me. Thank you!"

They have one person working the register and one person manning the pastries. During Saturday morning rush!  If you don't have enough people working then start paying more!

Horrible smell of urine in the \"gender neutral\" bathroom, graffiti on the door, no mirror over the sink-I felt like I was in a run down gas station bathroom. Secondly, my chicken salad was so bland and tasteless, and the croissant tasted like it was made last week- it was so dry I could barely swallow! Amelie's used to be a great restaurant in NoDa, before they relocated, but the new NoDa location is an absolute disappointment and a completely overrated establishment. I won't be returning."

And for that person, who's one job appears to be to ring up very simple orders to look perturbed when someone dares interrupt their browsing is annoying to say the least. There needs to be a dedicated coffee line. Food quality is good, but ruined by bad service."
