During my visit, there was only one staff member handling both coffee brewing and billing responsibilities. Despite her commendable effort and hard work, the wait time was unreasonably long - over 10 minutes with just two people ahead in line. All three of us customers experienced the same extended wait. While the employee deserves praise for managing multiple tasks single-handedly, this situation reflects poorly on the coffee shop's management. They urgently need to hire additional staff to provide an efficient service experience and create a more manageable workload for their employees. Such extended wait times for a simple coffee order are unacceptable and could drive away potential regular customers if not addressed promptly.                "

The space was aesthetically pleasant but unbelievably noisy and busy.\n\nWhat I wish was advertised on google was that this coffee shop is inside of a church. Nothing against it, just not the atmosphere I was looking for as a place to study for several hours. There was also summer camp going on at that time so it was bustling with kids and very noisy. Again, nothing against it, it just wasn't what I was looking for and would have chosen a different coffee shop given that information."

Baristas were so kind and didn't roll their eyes at me when i said i didn't know what i wanted besides no sugar, they gave me a recommendation of cold brew and i added oat milk. So good!!! Plenty of luxury seating inside in addition to the plentiful seating with and without shade outside. There's also a disc golf course so we had a great time chatting, sipping, and walking and relaxing. Highly recommend. Could believe how empty it was for a Saturday at 10am but I've lived here for 3 years and just now found it so maybe they need to advertise more. Hopefully this review will help more ppl find Kunu!!!"
