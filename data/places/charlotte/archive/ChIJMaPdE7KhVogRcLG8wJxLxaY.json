There was plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. During our visit, we chose to sit indoors, where a live band was playing. While the music was a bit louder than we'd prefer, it provided great background noise as we played cards. Overall, we highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a fun and lively place to enjoy with friends."

The website lists a whole line of food available (mostly sausages on French bread, other hot dogs and chips). Turns out they have ZERO food except some pimento cheese and the occasional (overpriced) food truck. Meanwhile, the drink selection is minimal compared to other breweries. They really should update their website to what they honestly serve.\n\nEdited to add: This is my OPINION. Everyone is entitled to one. Ergo, my review (whether or not they update their site and pages) stands as is. Bottom line, our group has enjoyed other breweries (with larger beer selections, better customer service and a heck of a lot less head poured in the glass) more than this place. I have no questions other than why this company gets \"all up in their feelings\" and wastes time responding negatively to customer replies instead of using them as constructive feedback to improve their business. We didn't like the place. It is obviously good for others. It wasn't good for us. That's all. The end.\n-\\_ (tsu)_/-"

We indulged in beer slushies over trivia and bar snacks last week and had the best time. Always something to do, or do nothing over your beverage of choice here in peace. I love their slogan, Make Charlotte Weird! If you're tired of the shiny things, check this place out. It feels handmade in every awesome way. Bonus, tons of parking... for free! Support the good ones so they can stick around and keep doing what they love."

Absolutely speechless at the HORRIBLE customer service I received on 04/20/2023 from the bartender with brown hair who said she was the manager but refused to provide her name. She gave me the owners card and I will be contacting him as this woman needs to be fired and not allowed to work at any other bar.\n\nSo first of all I was here attending a Paralegal Conference and was 100% sober. I would never dare attend a business event drunk or under the influence. And I explained this to the bartender. We were given two tokens to use and I had one cider. I finished that drink and went to order another and to my absolute surprise I was cut off! After ONE drink! I asked why I was being cut off and the only explanation I was given was that I was sweating. I told her that I was extremely embarrassed as I have a medical condition called hyperhidrosis that causes my head, neck and armpits to sweat uncontrollably especially when there is temperature changes such as being outside and then going inside to A/C. Mind you, I don't even like drinking. So it was NEVER about the drink and more about my reputation to uphold in front of my firm and their associates. I asked everyone from my group if I was displaying odd behavior and they all said no other than my light sweating.\n\nI would not recommend this bar to anyone and I will add this. Karma is always working. This bar is in the hood. This bar will be shut down in no time. Funny that the name is \"Petty Thieves\" they ARE petty thieves. They refused to serve my remaining drink I had a token for and did not refund the person paying for all the drinks.\n\nThis bar is a joke and furthermore the fact they close at 10 p.m. speaks about the area they are located in. If they stayed open any later than that, due to the location, they would have so much crime and bad customers they would be forced to shut down. But of course their owners are cheap and couldn't afford a location in a nicer spot. So they operate in the hood and hire staff that reflects that.\n\nAVOID THIS BAR AT ALL COSTS!"

The staff have always been warm and inviting, making you feel comfortable having a beer alone or with a large group. A massive positive about Petty Thieves is that their live music is of quality talent and never so loud that you can't converse with people at the same time."

I came back 2 minutes later and my beer was gone. My brother then informed me that the bartender (short, bald guy with tattoos) came up to them and asked if I was going to finish the beer to which he replied \"yes, he's just in the bathroom and will be back in a moment.\" The bartender acknowledged this and went about his business but apparently came back and threw out my beer anyway. I was given no explanation for this or a replacement beer as this all happened over the course of a few minutes while in the bathroom and would have taken even less time to finish the beer after I got back, but the bartender apparently couldn't be bothered to wait another second to finish his duties for the night and instead chose to be quite petty and steal the beer I paid for. If nothing else, at least the name of this place fits the bill..."

It's in a bit of a weird location that's not visible from a main street, so I circled around the area for a bit before I could find it.\nThe beer list is highly creative with a wide range of artistic, almost experimental beers along with some staples. I had an IPA and barrel aged stout and both were amazing. I also bought a to-go Oktoberfest that was also really good.\nTo me, the venue may have been the best part. There are lots of options for seating from private booths to game tables, to couches and partitioned-off casual areas. This made for a perfect venue to work, hangout with a small group of friends, or have a big gathering. The outdoor seating has a great view of the city, and is set up well to be very welcoming. I didn't go into the \"secret room\" but I saw some folks going in and out. Very fun feature for sure. I'm not one to usually notice decorations, but I love the vibe in this place. Very creative but welcoming.\nI don't come to this part of town often, but if I did, I think this place would be a favorite for sure. Recommend highly."

I had one of their sour IPA's which was actually one of the best sour ipa's i've ever had. We we're completely blown away with their customer service, beer and hospitality. Also, a HUGE bonus, they have mimosas on Sunday's which is awesome considering my wife doesn't like beer but loves mimosas! Thanks Petty Thieves crew for making our day amazing!!!"
