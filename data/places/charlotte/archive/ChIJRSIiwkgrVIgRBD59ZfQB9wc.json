I'd been wanting to try it for a while, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm and inviting. It's not a huge place, but it has a cozy vibe that makes you feel right at home. I went for a lunchtime visit, and there were a few people catching up with friends over steaming cups of coffee, while others were focused on laptops.\n\nSpeaking of coffee, that's definitely the star of the show here. I opted for a traditional Ethiopian brew, and it was unlike any coffee I'd ever had before. Rich, complex, and aromatic - it was a true flavor explosion. They even have the whole brewing ceremony on display, which was fascinating to watch.\n\nFor food, I went with the chicken salad croissant. It sounds simple, but the flavors were fantastic. The chicken salad was perfectly seasoned and packed with fresh ingredients, and the croissant itself was buttery and flaky. The portions were generous, and I left feeling happy and satisfied.\n\nThe staff at Jebena Cafe were friendly and helpful. They were happy to answer my questions about the menu and the coffee brewing process.  Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings.  If you're looking for a unique and delicious coffee experience in Waxhaw, Jebena Cafe is definitely worth checking out!"

We decided it looked interesting and unique so we said why not check it out.  Great s'mores iced coffee and chocolate drizzle croissant.  My boyfriend had a mint cocoa which he thought was great.   They offered a complimentary croissant to try after we ordered and finished what we had.  Very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend and check it out.  Nice and relaxing atmosphere too."
