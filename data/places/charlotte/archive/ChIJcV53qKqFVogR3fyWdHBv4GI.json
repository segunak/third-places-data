I ordered a lemonade and it was delish! However, there is a surprise behind the curtain near the coffee bar. A fully functioning pottery studio with artists creating stunning work. I was floored. I can't believe there is so much talent in one place. The owner, Debbie, is a master potter, artist, muralist, and creates the posters for downtown events. In the evening (check schedule) there are lots of events. Jazz, open mic, music bingo, singer song writer nights all happen here as well. Go there and be amazed like I was!!"

I got 2 deals for my kids, they got the clay and tools, and crafted beautiful works of art (my totally biased opinion). In Feb, I took it back to the store for them to color, glaze and bake them in the kiln to be finished. The kiln was broken and they had no idea when it would be fixed. I went back on June 21st and they couldn't find my kids stuff cuz according to them they keep them only for 60 days. I am upset that one they didn't give me a date when the kiln would be fixed,  second they didn't tell me they hold it for 60 days once finished. Finally the lady (I'm assuming is the owner) says if it is so important for you, you should have come back sooner! My kids are feeling so sad and heartbroken. What a horrible experience!"

The food options are very limited but I did like they had scones from local Breadsmith.  I ordered the special pumpkin butter latte as it was a less sweet choice for the seasonal selections.  I didn't love it and will have to try another drink next time.  I throughly enjoyed sitting outside on Main Street.  Inside, seating is limited and for small parties.\n\nThis is a cute place and I'll return!  Is it my favorite place in Fort Mill?  No, but a great spot I'll stop by time to time."

And if I miss a day, I come the day after. After my knee surgery I forced my husband to chauffeur me here for a London Fog. I have stopped my schoolwork to stop in this place and brought my books in, too. The little trinkets around the shop for view and for sale are so enticing to linger through while your drink is made. I love seeing what's the next theme in the front display window. I don't do coffee often but if you like REAL TEA LATTES, not a teabag and milk, but a real tea latte, YOU NEED TO COME IN HERE!\n------------\nI've been coming here for a while now for coffee, but today was a little special for me. I asked the young lady behind the counter for an earl grey tea with a side of steamed milk. I was going to make my own London Fog, because everywhere I order it, nobody has a clue what I'm talking about. She looked right at me and said \"I know exactly what it is, I can make it for you.\" I can't explain the feeling of relief I got when she said that. I wasn't met with the rudeness and pretentiousness I get from Starbucks, the clueless looks I get from Caribou Coffee... she KNEW my drink. The tea is a beautiful aromatic blend, and the milk was steamed to perfection. I'm literally nursing my tea because I know there's a bottom to my cup! The shop is so warm and inviting. I love the small quaint feeling. I will be a regular!"
