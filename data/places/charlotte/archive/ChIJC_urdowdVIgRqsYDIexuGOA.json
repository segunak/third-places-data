It's located/situated in an awkward corner of the road.\nI don't care for the parking lot. I can see turning in being a nightmare because of the corner lot being so close to the main road. There are maybe about 8-10 tight parking spots. I can imagine if they are all full people will keep driving\n\nI walked in and was greeted nicely. I ordered the hot Chai with caramel,  it was really good.\nIt's small and cozy inside. Great spot to come and work remotely or pick up a drink and a quick snack. Outside seating was a plus.\nI do recommend trying it."

We got there at 730 so I would assume they get their pastries delivered first thing in the morning but didnt they didn't taste fresh. The coffee was decent. It is a quaint little spot for a morning coffee."

And yes, I have a thing for bathrooms, and they did their big one with the design in there.\n\nWhile working, I had a traditional latte with almond milk and a toasted chocolate croissant both were delicious and gave me the fuel I needed to focus. The cafe had a steady stream of customers, from casual walk-ins to folks getting work done. There's outdoor seating and a parking lot, which makes it even more convenient.

The latte was so good, the proprtion to the coffee vs milk was perfect for my taste buds as i find some places put too much milk esp when you get it iced. Service was very friendly and they were quite busy which was nice to see for a newly opened business. Parking is limited but there are some areas to park in the area and you can walk to the coffee shop (however, park at your own discretion if you do this). I'm really glad a good coffee shop opened up near where I live, finally something other than bucks. Will be coming back!"
