Picking up our gorgeous cake was a breeze, it was ready on time and they allowed me to look at it and gave instructions on storing it until it was time to present and cut. My mom was surprised and enjoyed the 9\" vintage cake. Everyone enjoyed the cake."

I even had the batch house cater a work celebration where they made 400 brownies/bars and they were able to work with us to even have them delivered.

She was very knowledgeable about the menu and events at Batchmaker. She recommended the Oreo Truffle cookie as one of her favorites and my husband thought  it was so delicious. I chose the Girl Scout cookie and it was okay. The coconut filling was very salty and each bite gave a different element of taste. Yanel's personality was so much better then past experiences here with staff. Being that she has only been with the company since November she has really taken the time to learn the menu and company as a whole. Because of her outstanding service we definitely will start coming back.\nBatchmaker you made a great employee hire with her. Please keep her! I can't wait to come back Saturday for the Cinnamon Rolls she raved about."

People were DELIGHTED by the desserts, raved about the oatmeal cream pie, s'mores brownies and cookies all night and have reminded me frequently since that day how much they loved the desserts.

(FYI, they require orders for cakes at least one week in advance but can make accommodations if you need it sooner.) Anyways, I ordered it and brought it home. As soon as I sliced into the cake, I already knew it was going to be good.\n\nWhen I took the first bite, let me tell you, it was single-handedly the best tres leches cake I have ever had in my life. It was rich, creamy, decadent, moist--everything you could want in a tres leches cake. It's the kind of cake you have to lock up in a safe because every bite leaves you craving more. It was sweet but not overly so, striking the perfect balance--at least for me.\n\nI ended up paying $68.58 with taxes included. Some may think this is too much for a cake (like my mom), but at the end of the day, when it comes to cakes, I'd rather pay almost $70 for a high-quality cake and be satisfied than $20 for a low-quality one and be unsatisfied.\n\nP.S. I also got some miscellaneous items like their Oreo cookie, cinnamon coffee cake, and chocolate chip cookie with a chocolate bar in the middle. That cookie was insanely good; it easily ranks as the second best cookie I've ever had in my life--10/10 (I'm not even going to lie, if I had more of the Chocolate chip cookies, I would've eaten them all that night ). The Oreo cookie was a little too sweet for me--7/10, but the cinnamon coffee cake was good too--8/10.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place and will definitely be doing business with them in the future."

The cookie tasted just like creme brulee. These pics were from two visits, my boxes and the friend I brought back to this must try bakery!"

It was my wife's birthday and I had her day all planned out and losing my wallet would have ruined it completely! Thank the Lord Jesus Christ for answering prayer and using that sweet young lady. Now to the food, it was absolutely exceptional. Hands down the best bakery in the Charlotte metro area. My family got Oreo truffle cookie, chocolate pudding cookie, pumpkin s'mores, and the oatmeal cream pie (Some names maybe wrong) Each had its own unique favorite but all were so moist and delicious. My favorite was the pumpkin s'mores but would highly recommend them all. We'll definitely be back to support The Batch House and would like to say a special thank you to the young lady again for saving the day!"

My husband said they would have waited for me inside but the people working made sure he overheard their conversation (Something like, \"Good thing we move cleaned everything since we're closing.\") So he felt unwelcomed. Which is not cool. We didn't really have time but we snacked for 5 minutes outside on the brownies and it was only 11:50 by the time we were on our way. It was our first time here and will probably not come back since we can have better brownies elsewhere and they could have been friendlier."

Scorned by many a sad, dry grocery sheet cake, people seem to have a thing against cake, which makes me sad. I knew if our guests had The Batch House's cake, their minds would change. Though The Batch House doesn't do conventional wedding cakes, we elected to order five different cakes -- and transport them across the state line (yes, they're really that good). All flavorful, fun, and moist, they were quickly devoured by our guests, many of whom made it their personal quest to try every flavor. The caterer had to wash extra cake plates mid-way through the reception because they had run out! Cris was such a delight to work with and the whole Batch House crew made our day that much more special."

They were all decent but not better than some of the other local shops.\n\nThe thing that Batch House has on some of the other places is location.  Besides having a really unique and relaxed interior space, the outdoors is a shared space with lots of chairs, tables, fire pits, etc.  It's just a cool place to hangout.  It's a least worth visiting and hanging out for a bit."

I asked for the lava cake dessert and the worker started boxing up the display model that was sitting on the open counter (not behind glass) for everyone to hover over, sniff, touch, look at etc.  When I requested one from the back, the worker said there were no more and didn't see anything wrong with giving the unsanitary display item.  If this is the general attitude toward sanitation and health at this restaurant, I'd be concerned about what goes on behind the scenes."

I also noticed with the other hand she scratched her head without washing her hands. After changing out her glove, I ordered two slices of coffee cake, a brown sugar pop tart, and the s'mores brownie. I've had the coffee cake before. It was so moist and flavorful the first time I had it. Today, it was good but not great. The pop tart was meh and the brownie was too sweet for my liking and had a very hard bottom that I didn't like. I wanted to like this bakery but I wasn't impressed with it."

We had 5 cakes of different varieties and one that our florist added flowers to. They looked beautiful. We had over 600 bars and cookies and there was little left over. People raved about everything we had - smore brownies, lemon squares, caramel chocolate chunk, dirty brownies, bananas foster brownies, oatmeal cream pies, brown butter sugar, banana bread cake, chocolate cake, apple cake etc. Cris and the Batchmaker is a must try bakery and I'd highly recommend if you're looking for a fun, delicious dessert option for a large crowd."

Everything in the store is amazing quality and delicious. Just ordered a cheesecake for a friends shower and it got so many compliments! You haven't lived until you've had their oatmeal cream pies. Staff is so friendly and I love supporting this local business :) Will be ordering more cakes for upcoming showers/events and getting goodies whenever I can!"

I got an oatmeal cream pie and a chocolate peanut butter brownie. I started with the cookie, it was amazing. The next day I ate the brownie. Honestly probably the best brownie I've ever had. The brownie was thick, dense, fudgy in the middle with a flakey top and had a great balance of chocolate and peanut butter. The girl working the counter was very friendly and pleasant to talk to. Couldn't be happier. I'll be back for sure.\n\nOn a side note, to the person who gave a 3 star review, I think your reasoning for giving a 3 star review is unfair. You're upset because a place is popular and sold out of their product that is made fresh daily. It's your own fault. Don't go online and try to hurt a business because of your poor planning. Having to wait an hour for your treats because a business is popular and has a lot of customers is not a fault of theirs. I hope you're having a better day today than the day you wrote your review and attempted to hurt this fine establishments reputation."

Locally (woman!) owned business, staffed by incredibly kind people, the coffee is wonderful (roasted locally by HEX Coffee), and last but not least, the quality of the baked goods are to die for. The cafe itself is really comfortable, well-lit and cozy to work or hang out in. Highly recommend! Charlotte is lucky to have this gem."
