            "review_text": "My first time visiting here as a local on 3/25/25 at about 8:30am. I'm a coffee shop SNOB so strap yourself in, boss.\n\nI'm not super impressed. Firstly, there's no direction anywhere near the store that tells you where to park. There's no parking nearby so if you're disabled, know that you'll have to walk about 100 feet to get here. There's a lot behind the shop but there's signs everywhere saying you'll be towed if you park there and then there's a lot 100ft to the left of the shop that you cannot enter from the main road.\n\nI ordered a Nutty Latte and it was delicious so that's my one happy point. I asked for decaf and oat milk and this is an allergy situation so when I asked for oat and the barista didn't respond I had to ask her if she heard me. (This is annoying, it's common at most coffee shops to have your order repeated back to you, and when it's a potential allergy you should ALWAYS ensure the customer knows you heard them.) The baristas didn't look too thrilled to be there and when I walked in I received no greeting, they turned to look at me and turned back. (Someone else's review said this feels like a place where you're not welcome unless you're a regular and that's pretty much how I felt too, so I can validate that.)\n\nAdditionally, my spinach and feta danish tasted exactly like plastic. Like it's been stored in the fridge in a Tupperware for months and it just tasted like whatever it was stored in. You know, like fridge leftovers? Ew. \n\nI also did not find that this was a comfortable place to stay in so I sat in my car to eat. The chairs were metal and just the way the shop is set up it just doesn't look like it's designed for a comfortable coffee shop vibe. It LOOKS nice but it didn't look like there was anywhere for a solo person to sit comfortably.\n\nY'all need an upgrade in a few things. Imagine if when people walked in they received a warm greeting and your order was repeated back to ensure you're getting no what you asked for? (Even Starbucks does this come on!!) Imagine if instead of bar stools you had comfortable tables and chairs to sit at. Imagine if your baristas advertised your coworking space to anyone that may work from home? Or if you had a huge sign on the sidewalk that said where to park? Or if your pastries were fresh and stored in a case instead of in plastic in a fridge? So many ways to improve!"

I tried their Dragon Breath energy drink they make, which I enjoyed a lot. It had a good caffeine ratio. If what they said was accurate, it was just over 300mg for their large. The thing I enjoyed the most, is although it's colorful it was not very sweet. It was just flavorful and easy to drink. I also tried a peanut butter bar which had a nice combination of chocolate flavor and the graininess of peanut butter. I got there just after 9. It was a tad crowded with only 2-4 spots open to sit. Thankfully they had that though. During the first 20 min they started to get a rush of take outs. Then within 30 min so a little after 9:30 it was pretty calm inside and a good amount of seating open. The staff was really friendly and patient as I tried to make a choice through all the options they had. I will definitely be back to try some other things out."

There was hardly any bakery and what they had was mediocre at best. I asked if they had been busy that morning and she said not really.\n\nWe got to going to a main street every time we went out because of the huge and delicious selection of delectable pastries, we'd buy more than we needed to try them all.  We got friendly with the bakers, Jess and Lex, they gave the place an energetic and happy vibe when they talked about their new creations.  It was fun and made Main Street special.  Plus we loved the idea that established owners let these young people try out new things and grow as culinary artists and managers.\n\nNow all that is over and Main Street is just run of the mill, not special anymore.  We are back to rotating, and after our last blah trip, prob won't even keep Main Street in the line up.  Don't understand why you got rid of the one thing that made you stand out.  Those lemon danishes! The strawberry cream croissant!! The fun to see what they came up with this time. And the little egg bites to start off with some protein.  And now it's all gone, just same old same old.  \n\nIt's such a downer. Off to Waterbean."

I decided not to get anything to eat because they really didn't seem to care nor did they seem excited about me trying their coffee shop out for the first time. So, I opted out of the food! Which a muffin is $5. Lol I would've been persuaded if they suggested something they enjoy, however. Oh well. Their loss, not mine.\n\nThey didn't tell me to have a nice day either.

In 2021 people have pretty much figured out how to make coffee that is at worst decent, and this is the first place I have been to in many years which had coffee drinks that are just...bad.\n\nThe iced americano I ordered had about half the espresso you would expect it to have, it was very watery, and much weaker than hot brewed iced coffee is at most shops. The salted caramel latte was so astonishingly salty, and again suffered from too little espresso; it was basically a glass of salted milk.\n\nGood spot for breakfast bakery and bagels, terrible spot for coffee.\n\nWe visited at 930AM on a Saturday. It is possible a new barista was on shift. Having worked in some cafes, it often happens that some baristas simply do not make drinks properly.\n\nI will add, finally, that the prices are on probably the top 10% high end for coffee shops, very unjustifiably, in my experience.  The owners have offered some truly ludicrous reasonings for their prices in replies to other reviews, going so far as to claim they pay their employees a lot (a lot is apparently less than I made as a barista in 2014 in a low traffic cafe). I originally gave 2 stars as a charitable score and have since amended my review to 1 star."

I live in Charlotte and this is 30 minutes out of my way, but I like to support new businesses and experience different coffee shops.\n\nI ordered a large specialty latte along with another drink for my friend that was with me. The first thing that shocked me was the up charge for non-dairy milk.. $1.35 for almond or oat milk?? That is the highest I've ever seen and because of this I ordered my drink without non-dairy milk, even though I don't like to do this. The second thing was that they didn't ask for mine or my friends name when ordering the beverage. I watched as someone else took my drink when it was done, because it was just set up on the counter. The person that took my drink had ordered the same beverage, but a size smaller and with almond milk. A few moments later they set up this drink of the counter, when I went up and said it was not my drink, the employee said I could have that one. She did say if I didn't like it, I could get another beverage. I'm a generally passive person and even though I did explain that was not what I ordered, I took the drink and left. My friend also was not happy with her tea and stated it did not have a good taste. I am disappointed with this first experience and I'm writing this more to address that they need to ask for peoples names with they are ordering and think about lowering the cost of adding non-dairy milk.\n\nAll around the coffee shop was very cute and the staff was nice, also the coffee was delicious."

            "review_text": "To everyone planning on doing business with Main Street Coffee & Coworking, I am leaving a review of my experience while contracted to help get this business open and running.  I was initially contacted by the owner at the end of June this year, and was asked to build the frame to the coffee bar amongst other work.  During the first meeting my hourly rate was questioned. I was told the owner (a Licensed General Contractor) can get it done cheaper by his people.  After the first meeting I thought he had given the work to one of his people because it was almost a full month later before I would hear from him again.  I was also promised that there would be a plan for the Coffee Bar by the time I would get started, since during the first meeting there was NO plans drawn up, just blue painters tape on the floor.  In late July I was contacted to get started, which I did the following Monday. When I got there only the newly hired (hired 4 days before) General Manager was there, whom I worked closely with to design the coffee bar in the owners absence, because there were still NO plans besides the blue painters tape on the floor. After multiple change orders by the general manager, the owner, owners wife and the owners mother,  and making all the parties involved  happy with the final product, and after working for a total of 49 hours and purchasing material out of pocket, no payment and no explanation.  The owner has decided with NO explanation that he will not pay me my second and final invoice which included materials used on the job.  I do Not expect to see any of the final invoice, at the time of this writing the invoice is more than 90+ days overdue.  I only hope that anyone thinking of doing business with the owner reads this and know that if the owner is ok with doing this to 1 person, he is ok with doing it to 100 people."

I don't have the same level of inspiration that I used to working in the same area, and I've just about overstayed my welcome in every Starbucks, Waterbean, and Barnes and Noble around.\n\nWhat I absolutely love about this space:\n\n--Comfy chairs: I know comfy office chairs are a must for any coworking space, the ones here are great. They are probably just your average office chair, but it feels 10x better than the one I have at home.\n\n--Atmosphere: I needed a friendly space to switch back and forth between focus work and casual conversation.\n\n--The Food: Downstairs from the coworking space is a state of the art coffee shop. The elderberry coffee is to die for (trust me, try it!) and the bakery selection puts just about everywhere else to shame. The only bad part is that I have to try to NOT come down multiple times a day for tasty treats.\n\nWhat makes it a decent coworking space:\n\n--WiFi is just what I need\n--24/7 access\n--Free drip coffee whenever I need it\n--The price is just right (and for flex options, cheaper than anywhere else I looked).\n\nIf you are looking for a new space to hustle and get some good work done, need a new mainstay place to grab a coffee, or just want to join a cool group of people, stop by and sign up."

Also a huge plus that it's walking distance from us especially since I work from home. Will be back frequently!!"

As former mayor, we have long-awaited the redevelopment of quality space in our downtown and it is clear that this addition will be a draw.\nThe coworking space is currently open and the coffee shop is nearing completion. The exposed brick and kitschy pictures and counters and little additions here and there immediately draw you in. The upstairs coworking space is just lovely and our Huntersville Chamber has seen an increased need for this type of offering.\nI am personally thrilled to have Main Street Coffee and Coworking in our town and as the Executive Director of the Huntersville Chamber of Commerce and Visitor Center, I am confident that this will fill many needs for our citizens and visitors!\nWelcome!"
