They are always ready to help out as soon as you walk in the door either to pour samples or recommend any new arrivals to their menu.  There is nothing better than grabbing a pizza from Livy's Pizzeria (its part of Heist) and perfect brew to enjoy this brewery.  Best of all is their out door space, its huge, plenty spread out over the grassy/ picnic area.  This will be my go to spot for long time to come, if you see me come say hi."

We waited 10 to 15 minutes before our server even acknowledged our presence and ordered two beers and a flight.\n\nBy this time we had gone through two crafts of water. The server came back to take our order and we still didn't have our drinks and were out of water.  After our server left we had to flag down another server to ask about our drink orders and were told \"our bartender is busy.\"\n\nAfter 30 minutes our food arrived piecemeal with one entree being dropped off at a time. I asked why our appetizer hadn't arrived and I was told it was on it's way. After another 10 minutes all of our food had been dropped off and we still didn't have our drink orders.  Our appetizer finally arrived after we had begun to eat our entrees.\n\nAbout five minutes later two of our beers showed up but no flight to which we were given the same excuse of \"the bartender is busy.\"  The flight eventually arrived with our absentee server who asked how everything was going. She left all of our menus on the table to further clutter everything up and then disappeared for another 30 minutes.\n\nThe service at Heist is terrible. We waited for most of our visit with no drinks or food. The only reason I'm giving them two stars and not one is because their food was good.\n\nThere are many other bars, restaurants, and breweries in the NoDa area; I suggest you hit any one of them before considering this dump."
