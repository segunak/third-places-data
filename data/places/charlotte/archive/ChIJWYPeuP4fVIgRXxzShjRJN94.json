I've never been employed by more loving and earnest people. The owners care about their customers and community more than\nI can even describe.\nI had just walked into a Monday shift when I received the news that my grandfather had passed. RC CLOSED the brewery so I could mourn. They lost a whole day of sales just to care for me. This isn't the only time they bent over backwards for our work family and it wont be the last. RC cares for people like no other business I have worked for. I know the business in and out at this point and I can verify that all things are done in love at RC. Fostering a community of love and acceptance is the top priority. I am forever grateful for the opportunities I have been given through this business.\nDid I mention it's the best beer in charlotte? I learned so very much about craft beer working here.\nPlease check us out so we can show you the care I have described."

He didn't smile; he barely uttered any kind of word - even when I tried to make a joke, you'd think there would be some kind of exchange. Nothing. Definitely got the \"order your drink and GTFO\" vibe. I thought maybe I was misreading the vibe but my friends agreed they felt the same way. GTFO is exactly what I wanted to do as I did not feel welcome.\n\nI also didn't love what I got. I got a ginger flavored beer alternative something and it was very sweet like drinking straight up soda.\n\nI don't go to breweries often but when I do, this place isn't gonna be on my list. The service and drink left a sour taste in my mouth (literally) and with all the breweries in Charlotte, there are plenty more to choose from."

Their biggest focus clearly are the big juice-bomb hazy IPAs which they absolutely crush (see: Lightning series).\n\nTheir only weakness is the beer is a little overpriced IMO for North Carolina, but not shocking to see premium prices for premium brew.\n\nDefinitely worth a stop for beer lovers."

You had to do everything yourself  through the app. Someone needs to tell them Covid is over and customer service is cool again! No one would come to the table or even answer a question and there was no one behind the bar. All the employees were hiding in the back and would pop out just long enough to run orders to tables. We scanned the QR code to place our order but there we several screens to get through before we could actually place the order. You go to a bar to socialize not to be stuck behind a screen. Everyone had just come from work and the last thing we wanted was an entirely self serve experience. Counter service would have been better. When the food and beers came out you couldn't get a word in with the runner. They dropped the food off and ran. We didn't have utensils and had to get up and get them and water ourselves. Then the ordering app has the audacity to autopopulate tip options of 20%, 25% and 30%. Excuse me? Who am I tipping? There was no hostess and no server and the runners certainly weren't hanging around to answer a question or bring us a fork. Oh and the system adds extra fees into the tax line item which I find super unethical and then the app charges you a $2 usage fee. So I went to spent time with my family but instead I spent the first 15 minutes getting everyone's orders in my phone. The beer and food are good but not good enough to put up with this nonsense."

After about an hour ish, the remainder of our friends arrives (total 14 people). We were still outside this entire time. It started getting dark and chilly, and I wished they had some lights or outdoor heaters in place but I get it, it's Charlotte so you don't really need heaters at this time of the year. It would have been comfortable though with the heaters. I love love love that this place has beers AND cocktails AND food. I mean that's a killer combo for a \"brewery\".\n\nI left around 8 pm due to a flight I had to catch, but could very well spend my entire night there.

Parking lot is just an extension of the inside and the parking lot is surrounding areas and streets. All so they can make there club scene for outside to attract more people.\nSo why can't they just play the music loud indoors?\nWhy do you have to ruin outdoor peace? Then in the late hours.\nDidn't your parents teach you anything about respect, boundaries, courtesy?\nThis place has shown zero respect in the time I've lived here that they give any thought or care about neighbors. Its a constant house party with no end.\nParents with young children and newborns are now starting to talk. Its getting ridiculous!\nPeople who live in apartments who have common sense, at least know to cut the music down at cut off hours of the night.

You get a little plaque that says you're occupying a table so nobody takes it, and when you're done just just flip it over so the staff knows to come clean it.  You can drop in at any table without a dirty table plaque.  No kids allowed at the moment (21+), and they have pathing for getting to the bar and back without getting too close to anyone not in your party.  Everyone was super nice, supportive, and it made me feel super safe.  On top of all this, they have some really great beers.  Very few of their beers have an average rating below 4 on untapped."

Beware of flights when choosing high alcohol beers as Resident Culture charges large up-charges.\n\nSome of the best IPA's I've had locally, nice interior and outside seating. Parking is frustrating, very small lot with little to no parking. Overflow lot sign directs you to a old gravel lot down the road that is not marked well, I went by the lot 3 times and only saw signs that looked like I would get towed if I parked there. I finally saw a little sign against an abandoned building saying it was the Resident Culture Overflow lot. I love the beer but the parking experience could be much better!"

He acted like it was a inconvenience to have our children their (who are under two and were either in a stroller or being held) If you want to be a brewery bartender in Charlotte, you should probably get use to children!\nAfter giving this place many chances, I think we will stick with Legion Brewing."

My two and a half year old daughter and her friend were having a great time in a small corner outside. They were laughing and playing around an empty picnic table. There was a small group of over served females and one male (who also is a bartender at Resident Culture) at the next table over. They obviously didn't care for our two kids. They continuously turned and screamed at them whenever they made a noise. I asked them to stop after the third time. The male bartender left the table to, i assume, let someone know what was going on but he never said anything to me or his friends. The females continued. Then one of the kids fell from the picnic table bench which provoked these girls to LAUGH AT THE CHILD WHO HAD FALLEN. I was blown away. A manager then came out to see what was going on and we explained the situation.  She went on to empathize with these aggressive, drunk and odd women saying maybe they thought the kids were being too loud. Seems like this place is more concerned with over selling beer to rude drunks than the safety and enjoyment of kids who are accompanied by their parents at their brewery.\n\nI was blown away. This place is big and loud to begin with and has a ton of kids running around. For a brewery to side with that rude and aggressive behavior towards innocent kids trying to have fun is unbelievable. I will never be back and none of my friends or family will either.\n\nDo not bring your kids or families here. You won't be respected or seen in the same light as the people who are there looking to have too much to drink and be an unsafe and unwelcoming addition to their customer base."

Also, whenever I go, they are out of at least 4 beers, leaving 3 or 4 to choose from. And yep, you guessed it... all IPA/DIPA's.\n\nThey are still young and getting going, so I'm sure that things will come along  in the selection department.

I'd probably suggest moving the food truck because of the loud, constant noise of the generator.  Also, purchase the sanitation sink you mentioned you need to fill growlers.  You're losing revenue and free product marketing because you're not filling growlers."
