I didn't think my county had a subscription, but lo and behold! They do!\nYet another way I can imbibe literature on my rides. Thank you for helping someone not even in your county :)"

I work for a company which we assist those with disabilities, non violent and truly gifted. Today at South Boulevard public library. At this location I was approached by security asking if I had children, I informed her I was with my client and he is autistic, about three minutes later a library employee approached me asking if I had children I stated I'm with my client and he is autistic. She stated to me my client had left out of the building, which he would never leave me. He was standing around the corner texting on his phone not bothering anyone which she could see him from the front desk, he loves to tour new libraries. She then stated we could not be in the childrens area and told us to sit at a different location within the library. I asked her was that listed in the policy that we could not be in the childrens section. She stated yes it was against the rules and we could not sit in the childrens section of the library. Myself and my client travel to different libraries within Charlotte multiple times a week and never have we been told that we couldn't be in the children's section of any library we have toured. He enjoys being in the children's section reading and looking at children's books they are his favorite. It really saddened me to have experience something like this. I returned to the library to speak with the branch leader Ms.Beatriz and informed her of how myself and my client was treated while in the facility and that I felt like we had been discriminated agaisnt and mistreated by the actions of the employee working there and how I felt about the situation. My client was sad and was disappointed because we have never had these type of issues.Ms. Beatriz the branch leader also stated in the policy it stated that we could not be in the childrens sections of the library. The pamphlet she showed me did not state such a thing, just informed you of what they have in the library. I tried reaching out to Ms.Beatriz by phone to file a complaint and was informed by Mr.O that she was not available. She seemed very nonchalant and brushed the situation off."

The reason this library doesn't get 5 starts is because I am a teen and I was sitting in the teen section, I'm also a university student but I'm not overage for the teen section. A young white lady employee came up to me and asked if I was a student, I said yes because I am, then she asked what school I went to and I told her. She automatically assumed I was too old to be in the section instead of asking me my age or for ID she asked me to move into a study room. I immediately felt disappointed because she didn't do her due diligence and I'm just trying to get my work done. Not all college student are 20-21-22. Some of us are 17&18. At first I was going to just go to the study room but then I decided I should just leave because I no longer felt welcome. I should have asked her name but I didn't.

Daily, you can come in and request a study room (if it is open of course) for 2 hours just to be to yourself and work on whatever you need to work on.\n\nAt home I wish I had space like that but not quite yet ... LoL\n\nThe staff is friendly and funny. I don't speak Spanish but the staff is definitely ready for those that do.\n\nMy wife attends a class/meet-up just to speak Spanish with Spanish speaking people and for those Spanish speaking people to get to test out their English.\n\nThis library has a steady calendar of activities usually going on. The times when those are happening it isn't the quietest but nothing is overbearing."

Also you can reserve the computer with a library or guest card.\n\nEven have a cute kids section for the youth to do practically the same things\n\nPlenty of activities listed on the calendar  to not be bored and useful resources.\n\nEven the Queen Charlotte is there . #itakegreatpics"

The help was friendly, and courteous. You feel the open space inside and will be able to take tour time with the purpose of your visit.
