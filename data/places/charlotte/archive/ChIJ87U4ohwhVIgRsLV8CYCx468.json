I am houseless and came here to charge my electronics and my cousin is helping me do my college application so that I can get my grant and loan money. School starts in August and I'll be able to move in with her in California. The staff here has been very kind and helpful. They filled my water bottle and offered me food they were about to donate, which makes sense since I'm houseless any ways; it's going straight to the mouth of me in need. Yum! I don't eat gluten cuz it makes me sick and messes up my allergies and guts really bad, so I just ate the egg, turkey bacon and cheese. I liked the food cuz it wasn't overly salty or anything. I hate when food is too salty. I don't like processed sugars or too much salt. My cousin cash apped me $10 so I could buy a coffee, and one of the employees showed me how to use the app to get points and a free refill, but I haven't finished my coffee to refill it yet, but rest assured that I will! Mwahahaha!.. The only complaint I have about this store is that the music is too loud. I'm autistic and hate loud noises and pretty much all music with singing... the music is so loud I can still hear it with my headphones on. I'm trying to listen to jazz renditions of studio Ghibli music. It's one of my favorite kinds of music other than lofi, classical or folk musics from around the world. I stepped outside to smoke... now I must poop! Coffee and cigarettes are natures' best laxatives lol..."

Additionally, they were slightly difficult to pick up once they'd settled on the table for a moment, requiring one to either hold the corner of the page up from the table or spend several seconds trying to peel it up once I had finished signing. We had lots of pages to sign, so you could see how this would be a concern. The hot chocolate was alright."

As I was walking out, she yelled \"is your name Matthew?\"  in an accusatory tone and if I was sure I didn't get food.

As a local to this neighborhood, I was super excited to have a Starbucks with a drive through open nearby. The staff at this location has always been friendly. However, I absolutely dread coming here because it takes FOREVER. No matter if you order inside or outside, you end up waiting 10-15 minutes for your drink. Personally, I feel part of the appeal to Starbucks is their speedy service. Today the line outside was probably 15 cars long so I went to order inside and ended up waiting just as long. Not sure if it's a staffing issue. I know some businesses are struggling with that. Hoping it improves!"

I do think the manager must be concerned about a budget because the other Starbucks I go to in charlotte do not have this issue. The female employees are always super nice, but it's 50/50 when it comes to the men. Just a weird vibe that I have not gotten from any other Starbucks I have visited in charlotte and other cities. Hopefully this turns around, otherwise night swim coffee is about to open up and will be getting all my business."

Not even a apology! the employee didn't even care to ask what my order was. After getting their attention I stold them what my order was they still didn't even take the time to listen to me. Like I wasn't a paying costumer! So I asked for a refund and the gentlemen did do my refund but didn't even hand me the money. Just put the money on the counter and walked away. So a lot of things went wrong with my visit. Definitely needs a retrain in that starbucks. And will Not be returning to that store. All I wanted was my coffee so sadly I didn't get it.
