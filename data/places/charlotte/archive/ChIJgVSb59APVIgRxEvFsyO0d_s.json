The children's area was adorable. The store was clean and well organized! The person at the front was VERY cold and silent, to the point we decided not to purchase anything. They stayed sitting or silent the entire time, only getting up to occasionally take a photo and appear busy. The way to get business is to be friendly, social media posts will be there when the customers leave (and it was only my husband, baby, and I plus one other woman shopping).  Seriously, in this moment, the busywork should have been customer work (even just checking on us once). Won't be returning (and I spend ~$400 on books per month, could've been my new spot)."

It's cozy, it smells good, and it's full to the brim with books. YEAH, BOOKS!! Void of any gaudy trinkets and toys, it's full of books. Oh there are some trinkets, but they are extremely bookish and cozy and cute. But the books! David curates his inventory to carry the best of the best. Orthodox religion, education, lifestyle, fiction and non-fiction, children's and young readers, and more. He has all the classics, and the best modern selections. The young readers section is full of wholesome material, so I can trust my kids can pick a good book. The children's section is filled with the most beautiful picture books, and there are toys and stuff, so my kids can play without ever seeming like a burden. OH! And there are used books scattered about, so you might get the exciting moment of grabbing a book off the shelf and seeing the used price tag. And there is David, the owner, who is the nicest guy. He's not just some guy behind the counter - you can tell he truly has a passion for books and art, which is evident by the number of podcasts he hosts. Anyways. This review was supposed to sound good because I want to convince everyone to go. Because is there is any place I want to become a Concord institution (along side Mullis Music), it's Goldberry Books. I hope in 30 years my kids go to buy books from David."

Although it seems they had a little of everything, including bestsellers, you won't find stacks of trendy-author, cookie cutter paperbacks. You WILL find thousands of interesting books you didn't even realize you wanted, hundreds of books you should buy for your family and friends, and even a great selection of unique cards and gifts for that cool, and perhaps a tad nerdy, person who will appreciate the effort.  Their children's book section was so thoughtfully and carefully curated, I  wanted to buy a shelf full for the grandkids I don't even have yet!\nAll of the great things to say about the store wouldn't be complete without mentioning the service: friendly, helpful, and not pushy or annoying.\nIt was hard to leave, and I'm already planning another trip!"

Their in-store selection is somewhat meager at the moment, but I think it will grow as word-of-mouth spreads and they get donations from the community. Bottom line: really excited to see this place take off, and I look forward to visiting often!"

You can see and touch the books, skim through them, and really take your time in a quiet space to make your decision. It makes the whole experience more humane and brings back a sense of respect for the work that goes into writing, editing, designing, and publishing. Books are important, they can shape who we are and change our lives forever, they shouldn't be delivered in a cardboard box next to your subscribe-and-save toilet paper. Shop local, buy your books from real people who deserve your time, attention, and money."
