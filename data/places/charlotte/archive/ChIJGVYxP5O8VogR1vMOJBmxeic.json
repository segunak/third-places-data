It looks like a converted garage studio, turned into a pretty cafe. With outdoor seating as well as indoors, you can enjoy your treat and then go back for more.\n\nThin Mint Coffee (LG): Great flavors, although could have used a little more mint.\n\nAlmond Croissant: I elected to have mine heated up. This was great, flakey, and tasty. It has enough room on the inside for meat and cheese (I'll have to ask if they do that).\n\nOverall, a great experience, but it can get busy  I came in when there were three people eating. Now the place is packed. Doesn't look like it affected their ability to serve though. Very efficient.  "

Holly during my travels in Charlotte, and it's been my go-to for the past two weeks.\n\nHere's the scoop: killer coffee, killer playlists, and killer pastries--all at prices that will make you smile. Plus, if you're in need of a workspace, they've got you covered with plenty of outlets and desks.\n\nBut what really sets this place apart is the vibe. It's like Cheers, but with coffee. Everyone knows each other, and the owners and staff treat you like family. Seriously... I've never experienced customer service this good.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: it's worth the drive. Whether you're coming from Belmont, the airport, or anywhere in Charlotte, trust me, it's worth it. I've traveled the country for work and stopped in my fair share of coffee shops, but if I could take one back home with me, this would be it.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Swing by Catawba Coffee Co. and join the family.\n\nYou won't regret it!"

Unfortunately, I have to mention a couple negatives and I wish I wouldn't have to since this is the only true coffee shop in Mount Holly. The physical marketing of this place lacks, you could barely tell this id a coffee shop from the outside. I am guessing their revenue comes mostly from the locals that know. Lastly, and most regrettably,  the coffee used to make lattes, not sure if that's their main blend, I believe it to me Guatemalan coffee, tasted just like mean mug coffee co, and in my opinion just doesn't have a good taste. Wish these things will change as they are very conveniently located and the service is amazing."

The place is located near the main street of Mount Holly, so there are many walkable interesting places around this coffee shop. The place is quite small and it may be not too comfortable to sit around for long, but the drinks are excellent. The staff is very friendly and they serve your drinks with happiness- unlike many others who just serve you robotically.\n\nParking is nearby and there are lots of spaces to park. They have a restroom for the customers."

And then she finally stops what she is doing . Mind you didn't say what can I get you . No greeting no words lol. So finally I just ordered and I'm like I'll take a ice latte caramel please with 4 sugar and she's like YOU CAN PUT THAT IN YOURSELF OUT THERE.. I was like ok ... thats fine . Most coffee spots I go to put it in but anyways lmao like WTH is all the rudeness and being cut off like that for ?? Esci when it wasn't even busy.. no one I mean no one was in there .. then .. afterwards I tasted the coffee and it was watered down and no espresso just milk and watered down. She clearly can't make a coffee to save her life either . So maybe that's why she was so pressed. Anyways won't be back . Got racist vibes from that shop & lady."

The drink I got today (which I drank a little bit of before I took a photo) was a PB Mocha Frappe. Very delicious.\n\nI think my favorite thing to say about this place is definitely how accurate the descriptions of the drinks are. In every specialty drink I've tried, I could taste every flavor they listed on the menu without one being too overpowering. The employees really know what they're doing. Would also say very reasonable price for the drinks. $4.25 for a very enjoyable and high quality coffee is absolutely worth it to me.\n\nWould recommend their cookies when they have them as well! Take a seat and finish some work, too, this place is perfect for just getting together with friends or studying for an exam."

We moved to the area at the beginning of the year and having been coming just about every week since. It is such a calm and quaint shop, the employees are always kind and welcoming! My boyfriend has had his tried and true drink since the start and I have had fun trying different ones! My favorite has been the buttery pumpkin latte  I also really like the mocha lavender! Both drinks have the right amount of coffee/espresso, oat milk, and sweet for me! We also typically snag a muffin, scone or bagel while we're there! So yummy too \nAll in all we love this shop and will always come back to support and get our coffee fix! If I could give them more than 5 stars I would."

So I finished shopping and put it in the phone for directions and off we went. I highly recommend this coffee shop and plan to visit the cute little town of Mt Holly while you are there.. We were just heading there for the cider but spent time there checking out all the shops. The people there were so friendly and I will make sure to stop in on next visit to the area.

It's great having a local place to grab a table for a little while and enjoy chill vibes.\nToday especially, they had a trio playing Christmas Carols on cello and someone was selling their wears - pretty festive and feels cozy."
