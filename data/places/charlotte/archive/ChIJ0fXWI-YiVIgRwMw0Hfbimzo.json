The 2nd time a lady wouldn't allow me to stay inside the class my daughter was taking. It was an art class! I like to be there so I can see what she's learning and converse with her afterwards more in depth. Again, no other library cares if parents stay in the class quietly sitting in a corner. Do better Mint Hill staff. It's  a library, not a prison."

They also have great book recommendations for all ages, be sure to ask. I believe the storytimes and library programs helped my daughter to read before she turned three, she's now on chapter books recommended by them. I would give this branch a million stars if I could. Thanks to them my child has a passion for reading. And the homeschool programs are spectacular!"
