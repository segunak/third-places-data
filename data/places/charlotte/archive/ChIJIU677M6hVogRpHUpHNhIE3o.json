I really love the taste of their coffee; it's freshly brewed in house- I got a bag of espresso to make lattes at home. There is plenty of space indoors and outdoors to sit and work- tables, comfy chairs, and couches. The atmosphere is conducive and peaceful for working. The staff is friendly and have already remembered my name although I've only been a few times. I also really loved how they were playing Christian music a few times when I've visited. They have cute merchandise as well. I didn't try the food but from what I saw and smelled it looked delicious. Platform Coffee is 10/10!"

Yet, I did like the variety seating options from basic 2 seater tables to cushioned seating. The varying seating options was all on one side opposite the coffee roasting operation. While there was a shortage of outlets on the coffe roasting side, the other side was cozy with outlets along the bench seating.\nNow, they offered basic coffee and tea. Yet, they also had speciality drinks and seasonal creations. I got their seasonal espresso with hints of orange and cranberry. It was different but in a good way. I also got there cinnamon roll. The roll was pretty good but the icing was a bit much. Luckily, my wife got their blueberry muffin and preferred my roll. So, I gladly switched with her. I would try it again if I were in the area."

            "review_text": "It's more than just a coffee shop. Located at The Union at Station West. Was surprised to see that there was plenty of parking in their parking area as well as side street parking even though I arrived during peak lunch time. Walking up the shop, you are immediately greeted with christmas decorations and vibes! Upon entering, I was also surprised by how spacious they were and ample seating options! There are lots of tables to choose from, including 2 couch seating options. Christmas decorations everywhere and such a cozy vibe. I opted for their vanilla latte, which was delicious! Just the right amount of flavoring. It was not too sweet and had the perfect blend of espresso and vanilla. I decided to order their West Charlotte Salad with chicken! For the price, you get a very generous salad! It was HUGE! Just enough to eat half and get full and the other half for dinner or lunch the next day. The greens were all super fresh, with no wilted lettuce anywhere. The vegetables all paired perfectly with the feta cheese & added chicken. It was all very tasteful and tasted very green if that made sense (haha!). I also ordered their Cajun fries, OMG! They were crispy and very warm and delicious! The best fries are hands down. You can tell they take pride in preparing the food as well as the presentation. It all goes a long way. Everyone was super friendly and efficient. They have a restroom and a family restroom as well and 2 high chairs in case they are needed.  I completely loved this place and see myself returning quite a bit during lunchtime to try other things off their menu."

Sometimes there's a clear favorite between the coffee and food; but here, both are so excellent, it's hard to decide which offering I liked more! 10/10 would recommend Platform Coffee + Kitchen and would like to come back soon :)"

We ordered the Conductor Pumpkin Spice Latte, Avocado Toast, Bagel with Egg, Sausage & Cheese and Brussel Sprouts.  It did take about 20 minutes to get our food due to being busy but we did not mind at all.  The coffee was great and the food was amazing.  My wife said it is the best Avocado Toast she's ever had!  Everyone was so friendly and the atmosphere was awesome!  We loved it so much we came back 3 days later with family and it was once again amazing!

I tried the moonlight latte and it was THE BEST LATTE I've ever had, I'm old, I've been to a gazillion coffee spots, and something about the UNIQUE ube nutty oat milk, perfect shot ratio, was so good. I kid you not people, dreams are made of this latte.\nI am devastated that it is gone because it was a summer drink.  but I'm excited for whatever the fall brings  oh, try the food.

I had a steak burrito from the lunch menu tjat was very flavorful, they said spicy, I didn't notice much spice but my husband did so that is subjective. He had a scrambled eggs in croissant with sausage and mozzarella, flavors complimented each other, it was nicely cooked and croissant was devine. Service is good, we quickly got coffee and our food shortly after, no complaints there. When it comes to coffee this place exceeded my expectations for sure, I am very particular about my coffee and i don't use any flavoring, I was surprised how good regular iced late tastes here. Their espresso machine must have great pressure and does not burn the coffee at all. Overall delicious. Ambiance is different than in other coffee shops i have been, place has modern industrial design and seating is nicely soaced out. Overall If i was in Charlotte I would come back.\n\nP.S. My ratings are based on whether I believe I could make a better or healthier version at home. If food/drinks/service impress me, I'll be happy to come back. If not the stars reflect that."

This is my first time here and I tried the midnight latte (primarily because of the ube) and a bacon, egg, and cheese croissant which was HUGE! Julianna took my order and talked to me as if she was genuinely interested in me as a person. She asked how I learned of them and explained a few things to me about their menu options. She is so kind and welcoming! All of the employees actually SMILE which makes this such a happy place. AND it is super clean. I will definitely be back again soon to enjoy this space!"

My friend was all over the bagel, and the Midnight latte was so good!! Mixed well espresso with ube flavor.\n\nI've got a strawberry allergy, so I asked them to skip the strawberries in the yogurt bowl. They literally just left them out without adding anything else, so I ended up with plain yogurt and oatmeal. The oatmeal was decent though, maybe homemade with some nuts mixed in.\n\nStaff was friendly and the space was nice, but it would've been great if they'd shown a bit more creativity with the strawberry substitution."

But it's not just about the coffee; their food selection is equally impressive. From savory sandwiches to delectable pastries, every bite is a delight. Some of the best casual food in Charlotte. I highly suggest the avocado toast- they make such a simple dish a culinary masterpiece.\n\nWhat sets this place apart, though, is its ambiance. With cozy nooks and ample workspace, it's the perfect spot to hunker down and get some work done. The atmosphere is buzzing yet relaxed, making it equally suitable for a solo brainstorming session or a casual catch-up with friends.\n\nThe staff deserves a special mention as well. Friendly, attentive, and passionate about their craft, they elevate the experience to another level.\n\nWhether you're a coffee aficionado, a foodie, or just someone in search of a welcoming environment to spend some time, this coffee shop ticks all the boxes. Five stars all the way!"

It's got this blend of cool music and a welcoming vibe that just works.\n\nPlus, the space is designed in such a way that you won't struggle to find a good spot to hunker down, whether you're diving into work or just catching up with someone.\n\nIn terms of parking - it's surprisingly easy, which is a rare find for being only 5 mins outside the city.\n\nI haven't been on the weekend yet to see how busy it is, but I can honestly see Coffee at Station West becoming my new go-to weekday coffee spot.

I don't even want to go to other coffee shops anymore. You guys have done something great here. Oh and the food is amazing. I love the porridge. The maple scone was delish.

We even had the opportunity to meet Toby, the owner, and were in Awe of his 30-plus years of experience in the business. The tour included experiencing coffee and the inclusivity of those who make it all come to life. This is not your everyday coffee experience; it's more like a spiritual journey of belonging and being proud to be a part of such a fantastic community. You will not be disappointed. Rest assured.\n\nThere is also a nice view of uptown as you sip your special cup of have around a fire pit outdoors."
