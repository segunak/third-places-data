After placing my order, they gave me a table number & asked me to sit anywhere but every table was already occupied. They said I could share the table with anyone, and I found it weird being asked to go to a table to eat while there's someone there with company or with their laptops, textbooks, etc. I have not experienced this before, so I opted to take my food and go. Be aware of this. It will most likely not be a big deal to you, but I just wasn't comfortable sitting with a stranger like that."

Definitely recommend it for a cozy hangout spot with friends!!!!"

Items were only bussed by the food runners when they would deliver your item. Food runners need help identifying the small order number signs.  The signs are so low the runners spend extra energy hunting the correct table to deliver to.  Very friendly, hard working staff but fine tuning desperately needed."

I got the lox bagel, which was super delicious, and a key lime pie that was out of this world. The atmosphere was perfect--cozy, inviting, and just a great vibe all around. I'm already excited to come back soon! My only note is that they don't have a ton of outlet plugs for laptop users, but my laptop was fully charged, so it wasn't a problem this time. If you're looking for an amazing cafe experience, Vavela is the spot!"

That said the dessert was delicious and the server salvaged the experience by remaking a cold espresso shot freshly. The taste of their own roasted beans was solid as well. Really cool place."

The line can get a little long, and people tend to sit for hours and spend no money. Drink 1 coffee and take up a seat for an extended amount of time\nNOT COOL CHARLOTTE!\nWe had about 4 16oz coffee, and 4 pastries.\nEverything was really good, and standard prices for a coffee shop in CLT. Definitely would come here WAY MORE OFTEN if seating was more available."

            "review_text": "Tried this place for the first time today. We arrived at around 10 a.m. with the dining room about half full. We stood in line for a few minutes and ordered 2 coffees, 3 items from the pastry displays, and 2 items from the kitchen. We were told the items from the kitchen would take a bit and we were okay with that. The cashier never specified how long exactly, just that we would have to wait for them. It took over 40 minutes to get an iced americano (they initially brought out an hot americano so that had to be corrected) and a cappuccino. The server asked us if we were missing anything and we told him yes, all of our food. We proceeded to wait for another 20 minutes with nothing brought to our table. I asked someone, who I'm assuming is the manager or owner, if he could check on the food from the kitchen and maybe possibly get us the items that were already prepared from the pastry displays. He said he would check on everything, so we waited for another 10 minutes without anyone bringing any food to the table before just walking out. I've never experienced such terrible service at a coffee shop, especially considering most of the food we ordered was ready in the pastry display and just needed to be put on a plate and brought to the table. I witnessed other tables wait over 30-40 minutes for their coffee drinks as well and also heard other tables expressing their frustrations with the service too. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or not prepared for a full opening yet, or if it was both. But after this experience I'm not sure if it would be worth going back. I saw people waiting for take out coffees that also had to wait  30+ minutes, often having to ask about their drink orders. The way this business is currently being run definitely needs to be reevaluated and changed. The store was absolutely beautiful and had a great atmosphere, but a picturesque store doesn't make up for awful service (with high prices)."

It was pretty busy when we dropped in but the atmosphere was so lively and welcoming, you wouldn't think twice. Halfway into my drink I realized they'd mistakenly brought me a 12 oz after comparing it to friend's drink and without hesitation the staff offered apologies and made light conversation, made me a brand new 16 oz drink, brought it back to the table and offered sample portions of house made desserts to me and my friend as an apology.  if you're in University City--scrap that, if you live in Charlotte, plan a trip here immediately."

The prices are high as well, but that's somewhat to be expected with how opulent the decor is and how large the space itself is. The menu does have a lot to try, but again, after ordering and waiting an hour, we never got to try anything. The nail in the coffin for me was when we saw a couple come in (45mins after we had ordered) and watched them receive their coffee and pastries almost immediately. The surge of business is definitely something they were not prepared for. If you're wanting to give this place a try, I'd recommend waiting a few months until they figure out a better system.

It's beautiful, and there's even a balcony with beautiful hanging egg chairs. I got their specialty Dubai Chocolate frappuccino, which was delicious and not outrageously expensive (definitely no worse than starbucks). I can't speak for the food on this go round because I can't really eat solids rn. The service was great. Everyone was very kind and attentive. I enjoyed not having to stand and wait for my drink. Since I was getting my drink \"for here\" they gave me a flag to put on my table to bring it out to me. It did take a little bit but they were pretty busy so I didn't mind. My TOP TIER number one biggest excitement about Vavela is the hours. They're open later than any cafe in the city by a mile, and very close to the university. If you're someone like me who likes to work in a place with some background noise (the music got a smidge loud at times but not unbearable) and works late into the night, this is THE place for you!"

I made a mental note to check it out next day and whew am I glad I did! Soon as you walk in the decor just greets you like a warm hug from a long lost auntie. It's absolutely beautiful and stunning! Some cozy and comforting.\n\nI head to the cashier while having to pass by some yummy desserts and said to myself I'm definitely getting one of these! I order a chicken salad sandwich and a peach mango refresher and head to my table. Didn't take long for the food to arrive. The sandwich was served on a nice toasted bun and that peach refresher was singing in my mouth with its bubbly deliciousness.\n\nAfter I ate my lunch I went back to order the caramel butter cake and a latte and I asked them to warm the cake up. Let me tell you, that cake was everything! Delicious, soft and moist. A worker stopped by my table to ask how I was enjoying everything and I said everything was amazing. He let me know they had only been open a week. Clearly word has already gotten out because the place was packed mid day. Perfect spot to go for lunch, or just to sit and unwind with a nice cup of coffee and a book or your laptop. Highly recommend this place and I will be back over and over again."

The location is perfect, offering stunning views that enhance the overall experience. It's an ideal spot not just for enjoying delectable treats, but also for studying or getting some work done. The ambiance is perfect for those looking to focus in a relaxed setting.\n\nI will definitely be returning to Vavela Cafe many times, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a combination of great food, beautiful surroundings, and a conducive environment for work or relaxation."

It was so incredibly creamy; I seriously couldn't stop drinking it. They had a wide variety of drinks to order. My friend got the Dubai Chocolate Frappuccino (which is one of their specials) and it was literally perfect. We also ordered a pastrami sandwich and a Nutella waffle. Let's just say we cleared the plate. The sauce on the sandwich is unlike anything I have tried before.\n\nThe staff was extremely attentive and friendly and gave good advice on what to order.\n\n1,000% will be my go to spot from now on. Please do yourself a favor and check them out."
