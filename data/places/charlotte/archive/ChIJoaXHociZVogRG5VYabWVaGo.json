This place is disgusting and needs a very deep cleaning and new equipment. As I sat here the other day, I saw a few bugs crawling on the counter by where I was sitting then as I approached the register, I saw a dead bug. This should be addressed immediately because it is gross, how are we supposed to be sitting and eating comfortably when there is roaches around? I will be needing to see a change in the cleanliness at this store before I ever return. All the other Waterbean locations have a much nicer inside. Avoid this one at all costs."

We didn't care much for the cookie.\n\nThe service was prompt and polite, and it seemed like a busy location with most tables both inside and outside being occupied.\n\nI recommend this Waterbean location if you're looking for a better-than-average coffee or snack."

While the sandwich is being prepared I added cream to my coffee and it curdled. I tried to let them know the little bit of creamer they had was bad and they should refill it. It was explained to me that creamer always curdles because the coffee is hot and did not want to replace it nor my cup. I then had to explain that I drink coffee every morning for the past 20+ years and I prefer non curdled creamer. I was glad to leave until I checked my sandwich that has no egg. Just a croissant with bacon... really! Who eats these things? One of them had salami on it, is that even a thing? I could only imagine how the conversation would go when addressing this problem with the non helpful baristas so I chalk it up to a learning experience and will never return to this establishment. Perhaps I can go by another breakfast spot and order some eggs to go on my meatissant and enjoy my curdled coffee. It's a shame because now all the surrounding breakfast options are jumping out at me as I leave... regrettable"

Today, it was packaged to go (we didn't order to go) and just placed up with the mobile orders with no communication at all, so it just sat there until I ventured in to see if the packaged food was indeed ours. It clearly seems that the particular employee does not want to serve any customers on her shift so we are happy to try out the queen city tea bar around the corner next time instead."

Cute, quaint, and nice place with warm lighting and lots of natural lighting through the windows - good place to do work or hang out. The person at the cash register was friendly and informative and told us about the different options and types (French press, Vietnamese style, and Aeropress) of brewing the coffee . We ended up getting the coffee flight, which is an array of three types of coffee to your choosing. We got the Honduras, Ethiopia, and Guatemala brews. I'm a basic coffee drinker (ice vanilla latte  when I do drink) so I didn't really know how much I should've appreciated these different types of coffee. I doused that shiii in cream and sugar  so ofc it tasted good in the end haha.\n\nIf you're a coffee drinker, I definitely recommend you give this place a try. The vibes are well worth it."

The girl at the cash register said ok so no lettuce, told her yes lettuce but no tomatoes. So then she replied ok no mushrooms and do you want mustard or mayo? This went on for about 2 minutes, because she got my order correct no tomatoes or onions or mushrooms since apparently a BLT comes with all of that. Fast forward to when I am back at work about to eat my sandwich, just to see that there was extra tomatoes in my food, if I had eaten that it would've been severe. All in all I would recommend the Latte but I would not recommend the food and if you do then please stress what you do not want on it, even if it does not say it, or else you'll feel like I did during work without a lunch."
