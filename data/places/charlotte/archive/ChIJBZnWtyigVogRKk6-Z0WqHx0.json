The ambience immediately stood out--unique and fancy, with an elegant charm that made it feel like a little slice of France amid the urban bustle. The decor was sophisticated yet welcoming, striking a perfect balance that elevated the entire visit.\n\nThe location couldn't be better; being right in the center of downtown made it a convenient stop amidst a busy day, yet it felt like a serene escape from the surrounding hustle. What truly impressed me, though, was the wide range of options to choose from. Whether you're craving a flaky croissant, a rich eclair, or a perfectly crafted macaron, this bakery has something for every palate. The variety was almost overwhelming--in the best way possible--showcasing authentic French flavors with a modern twist."

However, they don't because this happens all the time. In addition, they were out of chicken salad and also turkey so no Monte Cristo. I asked her what did they have and she basically said not a lot except for the bakery items. She said she wish she had a digital menu board so they could wipe out the items that they didn't have so people would know. That's not a bad idea however, how about trying to be in stock so you can serve your clientele. It's a great place to eat when they have the food. Bummer that we had to leave. Maybe next time."

So good in fact that I walked back over the next morning before we had to hit the road. I also got an almond torte, and it was really sweet. More like a dessert than a breakfast pastry.\n\nThe cafe itself had the coolest decor. There were several unique chandeliers made of things like pots and pans and kitchen utensils. There's also a lot of fun artwork. The place is huge too, with what appeared to be multiple levels of seating and plenty of tables.\n\nI'd definitely stop by if I'm in town again.

Whether you're catching up with a friend or just enjoying some solo time, it's a space that instantly lifts your mood.\n\nThe staff truly sealed the experience for me. Everyone I interacted with was incredibly friendly, warm, and attentive. They made me feel genuinely welcome and taken care of from the moment I walked in. Amelie's isn't just a cafe--it's an experience, and I can't wait to go back."

It felt \"cold\" for lack of a better word.\nIn this respect, we found it lacking. In every other aspect, it was the same good Amelie's fare and service we have come to know and enjoy.\nEasy to get to, parking readily available nearby, prices on par for the area. Good coffee, good food, god service."

Less obvious, I have worked across the street from Amelie's for more than 10 yrs, and I LOVE French foods, and honestly, I'm not that hard to please. You'll have to trust me on this because after reading this review you will doubt me.\n\nSadly, Amelie's consistently disappoints me. My biggest gripe is with their ordering, food collection process - it's confusing and customers end up asking each other questions (\"where are the napkins?\" You'll find them across the wide open space far from the cutlery) because the staff seems oblivious to the general confusion and doesn't set or manage expectations. A few years ago they did a process and space  remodel, but alas, it's still confusing.\n\nNonetheless, the food used to lure me in despite this frustration with process and staff's oblivion. But even that has become 'meh'- not the pasties mind you they are amazing--  Sometimes heated halfway through, sometimes flavors fall short.\n\nFortunately for me and my French-food-obsession there are multiple French restaurants in and around CLT.  One that excels where Amelie's flops, is Chez Marie Patisserie in South Park. They also have amazing pastries, and win on service, attitude and food as well. Plus it's a darling little space to sit and enjoy life. I don't work there, I don't know anyone who works there, I'm just a fan of their sunny spot."

They are on the pricier side but some of their bakery items are delicious!! The actual inside of this location is really cool and makes the visit an experience. Also, both times i went, their coffee (two different types) were both burnt and gross. I figured the first time was a fluke but the second time just confirmed i wont be back. The parking is also not great. Staff was super friendly and pleasant though."

Of course, they have their well-known quirky decor all over. We arrived around 10:30 am. on a Sunday and didn't officially sit down to down our coffee and food until about 11:20am. There was a huge line, and they had run out of a bunch of pastries and flavors of macaroons by the time we got to the front. Ordered a vanilla latte with a breakfast wrap. $20 for two items, which was thought of was very overpriced. The coffee was delicious, but i would not spend $10 on the breakfast wrap. Very bland, the potatoes were cut up in really BIG chunks, and they were cold, so they were very hard to chew. Overall, the wrap was cold and not flavorful at all. Other than that, all the employees were friendly and efficient. The ambiance was great and quiet for a Sunday coffee run. It is located in uptown, and there is a parking deck located right beside the establishment."

The last time I was at amelies i remember having the most delicious coffee and enjoying the atmosphere. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful in this location as well  and the vibes are very happy from the customers. The line was long but it moved quickly. The guy who packaged my pumpkin cheesecake macaron was nice and so was the girl at the register. I also got a salted caramel mocha. The lady who was making the drinks seemed a little stressed, I could feel her vibe since it was an open kitchen. She seemed a little busy while also answering the phone. I paid to put whipped cream and caramel drizzle in my drink as well but she didn't and I didnt really feel like asking her to redo it since she redid the lady's drinks before me apparently they weren't right as well. I think she could use another person in her corner for help on a Saturday morning so she is not overworked and stretched thin. But my coffee was still delicious and the macaron was great. I think you guys should get cuter cups to go with esthetic as well."

Pretty typical French bakery stuff - a bit rich and sweet.\n\nHonestly, the food was good, but the real star was the atmosphere. There's so much to look at while you're eating, it's like a mini adventure. Definitely what sets this place apart.\n\nSolid spot for breakfast - we left happy and full!"

The guy who made coffee gave me a paper cup when I had clearly asked for a mug.\nBy 3 pm they didn't have pastries left, empty counters. A long line of customers, the staff tried to manage it, but lost quality of service completely."
