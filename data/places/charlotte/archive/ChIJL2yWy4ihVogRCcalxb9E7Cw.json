I picked Optimist Hall because my son needed some play time, and I wanted coffee and an acai bowl. It was my first time at Optimist and it was early in the day so there wasn't a crowd. I ended up shopping at the Plant Shop too getting 2 cute new babies. My daughter and I both enjoyed Acai Bowls from Paradiso. They were reasonable priced about $10 each item. I grabbed coffee from the spot directly next door and my son got fries from the burger spot on the parking side of the building. I really loved the outdoor seating. The cute little court yard makes the space amazing. This is a great spot to meet a friend for coffee, a safe date spot or a mommy and me play date and lunch. Oh and parking is free for the first 90 minutes."

It's really pretty on a beautiful day, but I also like that they have a lot of indoor seating throughout the hall to eat at.\nYou get an hour and a half free for parking after you register your car, And after 3 hours for only 599 and there's also a full day is only $18.99 So still less than most parking garages in the city.\nThey have a couple cute shops. They could use a few more with fun Nicky-Nacky stuff, but overall a lovely place. A good spot,  to spend an afternoon, great to meet up with friends, or to bring people who are visiting the city."

We've been here probably a dozen times and it's never been good (except you Suarez sweets). I also find it to be extremely overpriced, especially cocktails at the bar. $17.00 (after tip) for a small plastic cup with an ounce of vodka and some flavoring seems a bit much.\n\nPerhaps it's because I'm a bit more mature (age) than the younger crown that typically congregates here, its often difficult finding a place to sit (even on the least busy of days), and I find myself annoyed for just being there. I'm not even sure why this place puts me in a bad mood but it just does.\n\nThat being said, my wife loves the ramen and we'll continue to come and bring out-of-town guests as is the tradition, I guess.\n\nEven the parking situation rubs me the wrong way. This place gives me an inexplicable case of the grumpies.\n\nBest reason to go: Suarez's delicious desserts and cute stationary store.\n\nHint: you can see post-mortem animal parts that've been hacked off and dried for tasty play treats at the pet store!

This place is packed with all kinds of food. Ethiopian, Indian, Mediterranean, Cuban Argentinian empanadas, American, Chinese and just such a wonderful diverse array of food. I have not had a single bad experience here.\n\nThe smashburgers are to die for, the dan dan noodles, empanadas, and the dumplings that you can get here are so wonderful. You will not regret stopping here and eating. The only issue with eating here is finding seating. It's a giant pain looking for seating. It's kind of a downer. But the food was spectacular and I will visit again and again."

The coffee spot is like $15 for a piece of avocado toast.\n\nThe burger spot is the cheapest, but far from the best.  Grilled cheese place is good but crazy expensive, I think the tots were $14, no meat or anything crazy on them. The empanada spot is great and decent prices. The bakery had a surprisingly good Cubana sandwich. My lady really likes the bao place for noodles, though it's a little pricey. The chicken place has a super good pimento chicken sandwich and reasonable prices.  The BBQ spot is OK, but not for the price,  except the macaroni and cheese. It's one of like 2 places in Charlotte worth buying it at, though it's $5 for a small side but I'm willing to pay that for this. The pizza spot was probably the worst. Any time I've spoken to anyone who are there the pizza was either nearly raw or too hard to eat. The bar in back is a decent price. Not good for a date night, but good with a group.\n\nParking sucks something fierce. You get a short time free which is nice (used to be always free), but half the building is used by duke energy so during work ours there's around 100 cars parked here even though they have a lot across the street."

It's just so crowded and the wait time for each food takes a lot. The restrooms were so clean for that crowd and fully stocked. They have lots of parking lots so you can find parking space somewhere just it might take to figure out and good part is it's free for 90 minutes."

There is an outside eating area as well as some tables inside. Overall great vibes!\n\nNote on parking: there are signs in the parking lot on how to pay. It was free for 90 mins I think (but you still have to register). It checks your time in/out when you automatically pull out per your license plate. You do not have to download an app, can do through a browser. I had a rental car and there was an option to only say it'd only be in my possession temporarily (good insight to the developers)."
