My order was taken quickly and the wait time wasn't bad but I noticed that a line quickly formed after I ordered and there was only one associate to do all the work.\n\nShe worked as efficiently as she could and got the rest of the orders taken care of. There are plenty of seating areas here, indoors and outdoors. However, some of the areas aren't clean and that may be because they were short staffed.\nOverall, I had a good expert but it could've been better."

Went to PGSB not mine but 2-3 a month I head in there. Being a person who has gone to starbucks for 20 some years you can spot the new or clueless person,  so I repeated my order 3 times, and I asked to see the cup he said it's fine. So I did 4 checks I get over to p/u and my coffee is wrong! What a shock! I've got a fever, and I try to not come off as the crazy cat lady, I ask what this order is and she says things back I have never requested, I said NO and repeated the order again, and she say 2 different times is this it? It's like no stop make the coffee correct and I'll get out of your business, easy! Then rather than look me in the eye and apologize she looks down a and puts my coffee on the counter so I have to move to get it, I'm right next to her, that would have had her look at me!\n\nY'all are getting a poor rating because of customer service!"

I brought my less than two pounds, 4 month old Chihuahua into store in my pocket because it was cold and rainy and living close  to this Starbucks, my car was not warm.  I was leaving town early and wanted coffee.  Cashier looked at me when I enter store, I was in line for approximately 5 minutes as cashier fumbled around with 2 prior customers.  When I got to register, I ordered to go drink and cashier immediately after swiping my card told me I needed to leave store because they did not allow pets, I said I was sorry, and he indicated that he would deliver my drink to my car.  As I see approximately 10 customers go in and come out over the period of 10 minutes, no drink was delivered.  I had to go back into store, now no one in line to see the cashier doing nothing and my coffee sitting on the stand.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER, I EXPECT STARBUCKS AND OTHER COMPANIES I PARTONIZE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO DO.  I will NEVER visit this Starbucks again, I will call the main Starbucks customer service hotline to explain situation and I will possibly boycott Starbucks completely in the future. Caribou Coffee has won my business in the Charlotte area and has never complained about my pet on to go order.\n\nSeeing the interactions of this cashier with 2 previous customers and my interaction, this cashier needs to be fired."
