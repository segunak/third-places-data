Everyone we met was extremely courteous and friendly! They helped any way they could and made sure that us and our guests were comfortable and had a great time! They truly went above and beyond and made this groom's mother one happy person!!! Thank you Jake and crew for helping to make our event one very special and memorable one!!!"

Service is always top notch across the board, and it's clear how committed they are to showcasing local artists & food vendors (their truck rotation is terrific). The NoDaHood markets they host every few months are always a blast.\n\nFor their core offerings - the taproom & patio atmospheres are welcoming to everyone and really clean; they recently added some pinball machines to compliment all of the tabletop and board games.\n\nAnd last but certainly not least - the beer. They'll almost always have something for everyone; clean classics, fun sours, heavier dark beers, stuff that's barrel-aged, solid cocktails, wine, and n/a offerings that are tasty and open the place up even more to families.\n\nThey do a little bit of everything and do it well. They're THE destination for me when I get to that part of the city."

I was super excited about finally getting to visit the tap house.\n\nThe space is super cool with a large outdoor patio and plenty of seating inside. We got a flight and really enjoyed every expression they offered. The Ice cream Paint job and Lunchbox were super crushable!\n\nCan't wait for another visit which shhh (I'm headed there now)"

We had the chance to visit 7 breweries on our weekend trip to Charlotte and this was one of absolute favorites!! Everything you could want in a great experience at a brewery. Beer is fantastic across the board. The service was helpful and friendly. Cool interior and outside seating. Several food trucks in the area and excellent merch to top it off. We had several flights and came back the following day on the way out of town to grab some to go as well, including two glasses, and a tshirt. This ranks up there with some our favorite all-time along with Sweetwater (ATL), Slow Pour (Lawrenceville, GA), Creature Comforts (Athens, GA), and Against the Grain (Louisville). Amazing!!!\n'\nBeer: almost everything we tried we loved. Got two flights and went back for more. We had their Double Rainbow (9/10), Blueberry Cobbler (10/10), Cherry Connick (9/10) and several others were strong too, Casual (7/10) and Zappa (7/10). The Cobbler was so good that we went back the next day on the way out of town to grab a to-go. We also grabbed a single of Fritter Waste (cinnamon sticks and apple fritter with cake batter sour ale). You heard me correctly!  :)\n\nService: extremely friendly, helpful, and welcoming both times we came in.\n\nLocation/Interior/Patio: it is definitely tucked away a little bit north of the NoDa area. We took the light rail to 36th street station and Google Maps took us all over the place, when there was a more direct route. It is very non-descript in a more industrial place, but is located by a bar and grill and noodle shop. That area seems to be booming with new construction going on all around. Interior is cool with tables and couches. Outside is not terribly big, but it was perfect for a pretty sunny day.\n\nMerch: they have some really cool merchandise. They have really cool glasses, a great logo, multitude of tshirts, bundles, and really cool artwork for their beers.\n\nSummary: one of our favorite breweries we've ever visited!!"

Divine Barrel offers a wide range of rotating beers, and Ben (brew master) comes up with delicious new recipes all the time. I didn't drink any beer at all, until I tasted their sours, which are absolutely delicious. I since had to change my diet to gluten free, but that's no problem thanks to rotating kombucha, ciders, a wonderful wine list, and delicious ginger ale from GA. The staff are absolutely fantastic and make you feel like you're part of their family. If you're into running or you want to try it out, come on Thursdays for Divine Barrel Brewing run club (RunDBB). It's a super laid back and welcoming group with all paces and they offer 1, 2, and 3 mile routes. The ambience is super nice, I especially love the hanging plants and that they allow dogs. There's also a bunch of table top games that are fun and addictive. If you haven't tried DBB yet, you're missing out."
