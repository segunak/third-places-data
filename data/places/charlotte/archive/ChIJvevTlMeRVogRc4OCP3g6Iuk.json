I've  tried almost everything! The Loaded Breakfast Wrap, the Turkey Apple Grilled Cheese, the Italian Panini, Bacon Egg Cheese (BEC) Wrap, the Chicken Salad Croissant Bites, Lemon Loaf cake and the many delicious flavors of Macaron cookies. Javesca is immaculate and very spacious with lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The service is impeccable and the wait staff are hard working and quite attentive. And the best part yet... A percentage of their proceeds goes towards funding their many food missions and charities. I rate this place an A++  !  Give this place a try. You'll find yourself coming again and again.

If I lived locally this would be my place to meet up with friends."

So they didn't come off as rude by any means just extremely awkward and did not look happy to be there at all. Nice place, good food, non existent service."
