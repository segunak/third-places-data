I'm not so much a cat person, but I respect what they are able to provide to folks who come in to spend time with the cats. And I love all the adoptions that have taken place because of them. The one constructive criticism that I will share is to lower the music a bit. That will make the space feel that much better. Love the MAC Tabby Cat Cafe "

Drinks were allowed into the cat lounge. They had seasonal flavors for coffee, and the cafe was decorated very nicely for the holiday season. The cat room itself was spacious, with a variety of cat toys to use. There was a TV in the corner of the room that played a slideshow with images and names of the cats, and all of the cats are listed online as well. Overall it was an amazing experience and I'll be sure to visit again when I'm in town."

The cafe is cute and houses an extensive menu, making this a great spot to come for a great cup of coffee, not just the cats! As a lounge, the cats were a mix of active and sleepy, which was fine by me. All were kind and receptive to petting.\n\nUnfortunately, the group in the cat lounge with us consisted of two children who were rowdy, and they made the experience less than enjoyable. My boyfriend and I were looking forward to spending some time with kitties, and instead we spent 30 minutes with kids who were jumping around (one of which consistently jumped in front of the cats) and dangling the toys in an attempt to make the kittens \"do a backflip\", which was stressful. In the future, it would be nice to see them have a supervised, children-only room, or different hours reserved just for adults. Despite that, I still rate my visit a 5/5, because this is not the cafe's doing, but the children! Your experience could be entirely different.\n\nAgain, I don't hold this against the cafe at all, nor do I the workers, as they were all extremely friendly, but if you're looking to avoid children and relax during your visit, consider coming during the week. I will be back, but likely during a weekday where I'm less likely to share the lounge with kids who are throwing toys onto the air vent to get a cat to jump down."

This is the best cat cafe I've ever visited!! This is my second time coming here and I'm consistently impressed.\n\nThe coffee is amazing and has so many fun flavors and seasonal options. I got the huckleberry latte and it was so yummy!\n\nThe cat lounge is very cute and has lots of art and decor that's perfect for a photo op. It's very very clean in there and doesn't smell like cat whatsoever. Most cat cafes I've been to have at least a little cat smell, but not here. I also like that they have plastic furniture with comfy removable cushions and blankets-- easy to remove and sanitize so you know this place is clean.\n\nThe environment is also very cozy and chill; dimly lit with colorful Christmas lights and rustic decor. It's a space I would hang out in regardless of the cats.\n\nThe cats themselves are very friendly and cuddly! They have 12 adoptable cats from the humane society and they are all very well taken care of and seem very happy. I would recommend coming here to support their amazing cause-- getting cats off the streets and out of scary noisy shelters fosters a space for the cats to be happy, calm, social, and really show their personality. If you're looking to adopt a cat, absolutely get one from here!\n\nCan't wait to visit again in the future! Thank you from Salt Lake City, Utah!!"

On top of that we got to spend an hour with 12 adorable kitty cats and fell in love with Lucy, Theodore, and Circe. It was hard to leave and the hour went by too quickly! The cats are well loved and cared for and we are already in discussions as to whether or not we should adopt one or two kitties now! We will definitely be back. Drop in and get some kitty loving and a yummy drink too to support a great cause."

Just park 1/2 block away at the 2 hr public parking spaces. The front door was a little hard to find on the left hand side.

It really is a beautiful location and staffed by very friendly people. I especially liked that there were toys to play with the kitties and places for them to relax away from attention if they desired.\n\nI went through the application process, and I am very happy to learn that I am approved! I can't wait to bring our girls home! When they come home, they will be Cake and Edith!  Do you get the pun?"

We go about once a week ( get the membership it's worth it!)\nPros-\n-The staff are so nice & helpful, the drinks are delicious, (only thing we haven't had are the smoothies bc they seem pretty expensive) the snacks and merch are nicely priced and great quality.\n- they keep everything updated on their FB page weekly which is great!\n-cats are so cute and most of the staff know all of them and their stories etc and they come check on you every 20 mins or so and play with everyone and it's just overall a fun time! They are all well kept up and have a super nice clean area to play\nCons-\nIn all fairness I really should be rating a 4 but most of these things are out of their control or just me being picky....\n- parking rn is crazy, you can't pull down the actual st most of the time because of construction and when you can spots are taken. There is a small lot across/behind the building (less than a 5 min walk) but that's usually full so there is a parking garage right to the left of the building (when you walk outside the cafe look left) that's the best space we've found so far.\n- I wish they had better seating inside the cat room. Most are so high, too low, oddly shaped, too small/big. Like I I just wanna sit down in a soft comfy chair or maybe a beanbag type, sofa , etc and relax with the cats. I end up finding myself in the ground or standing bc the chairs are hard, too small or just oddly shaped.\n\n- overall just amazing! Keep up the awesome work and thank you for all you do :)"

The staff was friendly.\nThere are two negatives that shouldn't affect the rating but patrons should be aware:\n1) the cats weren't as friendly as I had imagined (this is probably due to the fact that most are rescues). They're not mean, and some of the younger ones will play, but none were the kind that would walk up, rub against your leg, or even purr.  They did allow you to pet them, but most were napping when I went.\n2) The price/hour felt a bit high. If during the week, it's only $50 to get the whole room for an hour for you and up to 9 others, it should be closer to $5/person for an hour instead of $12. IOW, if you and 3 others are going during the week, just pay the extra two dollars to get the whole room to yourselves.\n3) There are only 2 parking spots by the cafe currently. So, plan on a slight walk."

The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about each cat resident awaiting their furrever homes. It's a great experience for a little feline-citous visit, or to tease out more about each cat's purrsonality before deciding to adopt.\n\nThe online reservation system is super easy to use. And if you can only come once, aim for the weekend as adoptions & new arrivals occur on Wednesdays, and it often takes new cats a few days to feel comfurrable enough to explore and play.

You can't pick them up but you can pet them and they can sit in your lap. I really recommend getting a drink because they are really good and so are the cake pops!

The front porch gives the cafe a quaint appearance and is a great place to hang out while visiting.  The cafe has some beautiful paintings of cats and has a large selection of beverages.  The staff was very courteous and the cats were fun to play with.  I highly recommend paying them a visit if you are in the area."

            "review_text": "This place is welcoming and gorgeously decorated. I will absolutely be going back. The peanut butter banana smoothie was so so good. I brought my kids and they are ages 2 & 5, definitely have one adult per kid if you visit and make sure they are ok with you and the ages of your kids. The rules are age 7+ and I think that is a good idea as the cats need to have safe rules in place so they are safe. The set up of maximizing this quaint building is done very well. There is a good bit of spaced out seating for groups of 2-4, ~5 parties of that or so. I am excited for drinks from southern strain brewery from Concord and other small businesses to be at this establishment for a relaxing night out. The front porch is a great place to relax in the shade outside. You enter the building through the side of the building. You get to the front porch by the outside gate. I hope all the cats here find wonderful homes! Cheers to opening a second location!! @kieraandtheboys"

The ambience is unique and cozy, and their roomy front porch is perfect for reading, writing, and enjoying one of their scrumptious drinks.The cats are healthy, happy, and absolutely adorable. If I didn't already have two dogs, I would be the proud owner of a new cat (or three)!!\n\nMac Tabby is close to two parking decks, but there is also limited parking spots across the road. If you have other shopping to do, they are located conveniently to Union Street and all of its fabulous shops."
