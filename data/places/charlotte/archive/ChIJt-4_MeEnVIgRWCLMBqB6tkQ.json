My daughter ordered a small ube and matcha soft serve and I had a 12 oz. mocha coffee with oat milk.\n\nI knew that I would have to pay extra for oat milk which is fine and understandable, but to charge $.50 for the cup for the soft serve is kinda petty. The cost of the soft serve was already $5.85.\n\nMy daughter really enjoyed her ube and matcha soft serve.   My mocha coffee had a burnt and bitter taste.  The coffee wasn't worth the $5.50.  My daughter suggested that I put some of her soft serve in the coffee to see if it would taste better.   It did taste a little better but not by much!\n\nParking was decent."

It was still gritty and not blended very nicely; the matcha itself kinda has a umami undertone. As I was drinking it, the matcha powder got stuck in my throat, hopefully it was just an unlucky outcome considering it is a cafe specializing in matcha. I honestly think you could make it better and cheaper at home."

It was my second time going today after placing an online order. I asked one of the baristas if my drink could have extra matcha in it because I the last time I got a matcha latte here I couldn't taste the flavor as much (I was as nice as possible when asking for these adjustments of course, I just want to make sure I get my money's worth ($6+ for a 12oz)). She seemed really annoyed with me but I brushed it off.\n\nAfter I got my drink, I just wanted to ask if I could get vanilla syrup to add some sweetness and she walked by me multiple times when I was trying to get her attention. The other barista helped me and she was very kind, while at the same time the first barista gave me a dirty look and walked away. I still kept a smile on my face and told them to have a nice day.\n\nI just wanted to give this place a second chance since there are no other good matcha places in Charlotte but I don't think I'll be coming back.\n\nEdit in-response to owner: This was on August 22nd around 6pm. Also, I came in again (Sept 8th, 12pm) to try the matcha soft serve, it was incredible and Kate was very nice!"

The maiko special is filled with a bunch of goodies such as agar jellies, red bean, mochi, matcha cake, black honey, corn flakes, and chestnut. It was such a surprising amount of matcha ice cream on top that you have to put in a little work to get to all the toppings. The ice cream however was super smooth and had the textbook matcha flavor.\n\nOnce you tackle the mountain of matcha, I would recommend making an opening on the side and mixing in some of the matcha ice cream and cake into all of the toppings, sort of like you would with halo-halo. That way you can try a little bit of everything and still have some ice cream to come back to. The corn flakes also added a nice textural component and the matcha cake is even better once it starts soaking up the ice cream. My only critique would be to have a little more red bean than agar jellies since it was a little light on red bean and heavy on the jellies. Otherwise, it was a really fun treat to stop in and try on this hot summer day!"

They said that they had given us a float and not a affogato. So we ordered the affogato as they told us and they gave us something worse, instead of ice cream with expresso they gave us ice cream with liquid coffee. Terrible and very little ice cream. We complained about it and they did not say anything. Also , for $ 8 it was a rip off. I am passing the word about this bad experience to everyone I know"

They were all milky and super sweet and no matcha flavor at all. I've been disappointed for so many times even though I went to the Asian-owned cafes hoping it'd be close to what I had in Asia but still no one could do matcha the way Asian people do back in Asia.\n\nThen I stumbled upon this shop while I was looking around. In Google Maps. It'd take me almost 2 hours to get here but I looked at the images and reviews and had high hopes that this could be the place where I could finally have real matcha taste. I decided to plan the trip to CLT and make this one of the stops and it was the best decision ever!!!\n\nI ordered the Maiko Special which is the parfait I used to have back home. It's got red beans, mochi, corn flakes, jellies, chestnut, matcha cakes, and brown sugar sauce/syrup. All of them were amazing. The soft serve was everything I hoped for in a matcha soft serve. I love extra strong matcha so personally it's not too strong for me yet but dang it was soooooooo good.\n\nIt's just so perfect with all the toppings especially when soft serve got into the matcha cakes texture it's just next level yummy.\n\nI'd love to come back for other flavors especially during summer where they have yuzu.\n\ngochisousamadesu.

I ended up getting a honey matcha latte (soy milk) and I enjoyed the drink, but I did not enjoy the additional charge for the milk. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll return unless they add dairy-free ice creams and/or eliminate the up-charge on DF milks.\n\nOn the plus side though, the baristas were friendly and the interior is very cute. Definitely would be great for studies."

The servers are around high school age, and a young man in a bucket hat helped me and was very kind to my friends and I and was very patient with us as we went over the menu. He helped us look at all the items, and I felt bad for taking so long to sample everything but he took all of our orders very nicely and got us our items rather quick. This place uses authentic matcha it seems, they have the bowls and whisks and it tastes great - very different from other places. My friend got the soft serve, and it was very pretty. I recommend Ube flavor, it is their seasonal right now. The place was very clean, and a very cozy feeling on the inside - good if you are looking to get work done or meet up with friends and colleagues. My only complaint is that the prices are rather high. I get that is probably out of owner's control, but the ice creams cost up to 10 dollars with tip and tax, which is a bit much. Our server was kind and offered us his recommendation of the floats, though, and I would say those are nice because they have both the latte and ice cream for the price of one. They have coffee and refreshers too but I didn't get them."

It tastes as good as it looks! Even though it was cold out I had to get one before heading back Columbia, SC. They are in a pretty big shopping center so plenty of parking spots.

I can guarantee that this special experience will make you say \"I love matcha so matcha!\" after finishing your first dessert. I normally get their matcha soft serve, but you also can't go wrong with their other desserts and drinks on their menu.\n\nDESSERT 1: Golden Shogun ($9.50) - This is the ultimate flex move. A soft-serve flavor of your choice (matcha, hojicha, seasonal) topped off with a 24k edible gold sheet in a waffle cone will make you feel like a millionaire. The matcha flavor is present, but it's definitely not one of the strongest I've tasted. I've made stronger matcha milkshakes at home.\n\nWORTH IT? YES, it's worth it for the experience and whenever you're in town (Overall 7/10)"

It's one of the very few places that actually has ube soft-served ice cream, which is a Filipino purple yam and is in a majority of Filipino desserts.\n\nService: Friendly and attentive staff.\n\nEnvironment: The cafe is very well-designed with chic, rustic decor. I love all the color details, backsplashes, free formed wooden table, and even the mermaid floor tiles in the bathroom. There are two black benches and a front seating area with patio chairs and two tables outside. The entryway has 4-5 bar seatings, and a couple of tables inside. It was our first time in this retail area. If you walk behind the building, there's a small lake full of geese and ducks. You can walk around the lake and it has a lot of bench seats. There was also a boba tea place in the same area.\n\nFood: We got the matcha and ube soft serve, on a waffle cone, which was super creamy and delicious. My husband got their matcha tiramisu, which they prepared when we ordered. I found out that they also have milk bread toast with various toppings. It looks like a super, fluffy French toast. I'll have to try it next time. They have that with avocado toppings, banana nutella, berries, and kinako mochi. They serve floats, coffee, teas, frappes, and other baked goods, too."

They had us sample all their ice cream flavors and I loved hojicha and black sesame. It was the first time I've seen either of these in Charlotte.\n\nWe decided to get the Maiko Special with a vanilla hojicha ice cream swirl. Overall, I loved it. It had a matcha cake in it that I actually liked. It also had a special matcha ice cream in it which I really didn't like, but was able to avoid.\n\nThey use the same waffle cones as Jeni's which I love. I tried some of my friends black sesame waffle cone which was great.\n\nWarning: the hojicha and matcha products have caffeine in them. It makes sense if you think about it but I forgot since I was just eating dessert and it kept me up half the night (I don't drink caffeine).\n\nThe decor is really well done. The service is incredibly friendly. I will be back (but will probably stick to black sesame next time to avoid the caffeine)!"
