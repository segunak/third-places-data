When I tasted it, something seemed off, so I went back to ask if it could be remade. I politely spoke with a barista (who I later found out was also the manager). She agreed to remake the drink but did so with visible frustration. She grabbed my drink and threw it away forcefully, causing some coffee to splash onto my sweater.\n\nHer attitude was rude and unprofessional, and I felt disrespected, especially as an Asian customer. It seemed as though she assumed I didn't understand English well, making the interaction uncomfortable and upsetting. I've been coming here every Sunday, and everyone else has always been respectful and welcoming. This was the first time I experienced such rude treatment, and I hope Starbucks ensures this behavior never happens again. I will be contacting Starbucks corporate to report this incident, and the District Manager can check the camera footage at that time to confirm what happened."

The cups were turned around with the stickers facing away so every time people approached to look for their orders, they had to pickup and rotate the cups around to see the names. I waited and waited and finally asked another young man who was working in the same area, if they had an order for my name (I wasn't about to ask her as I was afraid of her response). Well apparently they had missed my order -he said \"someone must have snatched it.\"  Then he made my drink and I was finally on my way. So I'm glad I asked. A friendlier deme"

That attitude she had is something you can't hide. Get nicer employees Starbucks. I don't care how long they've been working for you! And the other employee was a heavyset black girl with long braids in her hair. Y'all continue to keep these rude employees that are representing the Starbucks name. That tells me Starbucks doesn't care about their guest experience! Some advice.....if you r not going to change your employees then change your name to \"Rudebucks\" because my experience today was more like getting coffee at a gas station experience instead of a Starbucks experience.

I had the receipt and also my partner numbers to take the discount off for proper refund pricing. I was not welcomed as how how I could be helped by the cashier and the woman who came over to help had an attitude and didn't seem to have no interest in helping me. As a Starbucks partner I'm extremely dissatisfied with the customer service I received and I definitely didn't get the feel of Starbucks living up to it's missions and values.\nThis refund was done on 10/25/2020 at 11:36."

I have walked out more times that not leaving drinks. Food etc. because it takes them 10 mins plus to complete any order other than just coffee.  I am not joking walked in this morning and I said black coffee and pumpkin bread the guy said warmed? I said. Nope knowing these people and wanted to keep it simple. Got my coffee and 8 mins later walked out with out my cold pumpkin bread because I didn't think. Taking bread out of plastics wrapper and put in a white bag would take that long"

Great coffee and baked goods selection BUT don't expect to park near the store front, there's no drive-thu and DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT PARKING in the 'RELAX YOUR BACK' lot next door. There is nothing relaxed about these folks as they seem sick and tired of the Starbucks crowd. Think you'll sneak into their lot just to quickly grab coffee? First off: There IS NO quick in-and-out of this Starbucks and the Relax management knows it. Second: I've seen staff chase down 'trespassers' and order them MOVE. Third: Use a legit parking space.\n\nIt's helpful to understand that the SBucks plaza is deceiving HUGE. Two levels of shops & restaurants cover 1/2 a city block. Yeah. The plaza traffic gets crazy CONGESTED. Oddly parked delivery trucks and illegal, fire-lane-parked customers add to the mayhem. You'll be shocked and annoyed unless you know this in advance.\n\nSo chill out, drive past SBucks' 5 little parking spaces and into the big main lot where there's always space, even if it's all the way in the back by the treeline. Once legally parked, it's a short stoll to SBucks (and some unique shops).\n\nPS. Consider using their app, order in advance and avoid The Starbucks Line Dance. You know the one... where expressionless faces with blank stares link together in that inch-by-inch shuffle compliments of the inevitable l--o--n--g and painfully  s--l--o--w moving queue."

I find the staff to be friendly and inviting. Like most Starbucks they have gotten rid of the bigger comfy chairs. I can't fault the store for that.\nIt was a 5 star Starbucks two years ago.
