Let's put it this way, if you simply ask where the coffee comes from in a polite manner one hardly merits an attitude. \"We are a charitable undertaking\" was the response as he turned his back on both myself and my daughter only to continue sitting and gazing out the window. As a Rock Hill native I won't give them another visit. I am well travelled and was shocked to see this type of attitude in my own hometown. There's so many other great options within a 2-3 block radius. Unfortunately I've heard this often."

Since they first opened, my household has spent more money here than any other RH coffee shop.\n\nThat being said, my last few visits have been quite a disappointment.\n\nMy extra-hot latte was lukewarm when given to me. I watched it sit there on the counter for nearly 10 minutes. When I reached for it, the barista told me she wasn't finished making it yet. By the time I sipped it, it was barely warm.\n\nOn my previous experience, I asked for a strong Americano--light on the water. It came to me brimming with water, when I pointed that out, the annoyed barista poured out some of the water and returned it back to me. (The point was the espresso-to-water ratio, not how full it was.)\n\nAnd on a recent time visit with kids, their hot chocolates were gross-tasting. Neither of my daughters drank theirs. Money wasted. When we addressed the awful taste with the baristas, they told us that they'd run out of their normal ingredients and were using some cobbled-together mix. That's fine, but they should have let us know up front.\n\nThere are several good options for decent espresso drinks in Rock Hill, but this one has the best location.\n\nMy hope is that they can improve their barista training to match the potential of their location and menu."

The flavor was a  perfect blend of zero proof spirits and cold brew. So innovative!\n\nWhile there I also saw an iced coffee being made it looks luscious, will try next time!\n\nIn addition to my coffee order, I also got their peach fritter, and it was to die for. I honestly can't remember when I had a pastry that was so fresh and crispy - not overly sweet and topped with little pieces of fresh peach  a must!"

            "review_text": "Just wanted to share some constructive feedback. I might be in the minority but still wanted to give feedback. I love the Customer Service and the trailer that they serve coffee from is really cool. I've also purchased their beans and their beans are really good. The only drawback for me is that too much syrup is added to the drinks making them way too sweet. I find that most coffee shops make their drinks overly sweet and I'm really not sure why because it overpowers the coffee. I believe that a great cup of coffee is a balance between great tasting coffee and really nice subtle flavors. I will definitely ask for half as much syrup next time. Great menu and nice rotation of seasonal lattes."
