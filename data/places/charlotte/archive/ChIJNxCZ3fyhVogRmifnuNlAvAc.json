She gave me a recommendation for a drink and it was that was really good. I also ordered a croissant sandwich, so I picked a seat to wait for both. The young lady brought me my drink and told  me my food would be coming out shortly. Again, she was amazing. As I was waiting I played on my phone and then another young lady, with her back turned to me, kind of just dropped my food on the table on the opposite side of me (not in front of me, I came alone). Didn't say \"here you go\" \"can I get you anything else?\" And just walked away. I even said \"thank you\" no reply. \" That was really rude to me and felt motivated. Based off that interaction, I will never go back. It's crazy how one little thing can ruin your whole experience."

I waited a half hour for one breakfast sandwich and a cinnamon roll. The lady at the counter(who was super sweet) told me they'd bring it all out to me, cinnamon roll included. Though, they did not bring it out and when I asked, turns out they had run out in that time. I instead got a scone and I'm not being dramatic, it was one of the worst things I've ever tried. Bitter, dry, hard as a rock!!\n\nI know a lot of people rave about it, and the staff are super friendly,  but I have not had much luck :("

This was a huge insult to such a beautiful croissant! You start to wonder if the staff knows what they're doing with pastry. The scone was not even properly wrapped, but shoved into a bag instead of placed into a box. So instead of enjoying the glaze ON our scone we were just trying to get the scone out of the bag without losing all of the delicious glaze. People!!! Figure out how to properly wrap and prepare fresh beautiful pastries. And unless someone is ordering a croissant for a sandwich, NEVER SPLIT IT AND PUT IT ON A PANINI PRESS!"

The barista seemed really flustered, behind, and confused so maybe she was new, totally understandable. The man running the register turned back to help her make drinks. A customer went back up to the counter with a drink that he had already drank out of and asked to have caramel added because his drink was wrong. The guy helping the barista took a spoon, put it into the caramel bottle to scrape the caramel out, put it in the customer's used cup to stir it and then put it BACK in the caramel container. I thought surely, they would be taking this back to the dish pit. Nope. They then proceeded to continue using that same caramel for other customer's drinks. If that's what they're doing right in front of customers, I can only imagine what goes on in the kitchen. Super disappointing and gross experience."

I was crestfallen after my favorite local bakery closed (RIP Lincoln's) and trying two allegedly French well-known bakeries in the area that make mediocre pastries at best.\nI had heard about Sunflour for a long time and after finally trying it, I am blown away.  The almond croissant is THE best almond croissant I've ever had in the US and on par with what I've had in France.  The cherry danish was outstanding.  The chocolate croissant is PRECISELY how it's supposed to be: buttery, flaky, and the perfect inclusion of dark chocolate that is not overwhelmingly sweet.  The pistachio macaron was delicious, delicate and not hard (like at one of the aforementioned establishments).  Today I tried their soup of the day which was potato and ham, absolutely delicious.  Their coffee drinks are always perfect.  Every location I've been to is clean, has great music, and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend you try this place."
