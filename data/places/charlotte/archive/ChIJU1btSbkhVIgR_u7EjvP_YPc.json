There's even books for various hobbies, such as knitting crochet, photography, even kits for embroidery. There's even a space for kids with plenty of children's books and a seating area to read to children. There's even a free tasting of coffee and tea. I asked the person tending to the bookstore what is the process for local authors to get their book into the store; They told me that you must bring a copy of your book and they will look through it and see if it's worth having in the bookstore. I really like this space and the variety and hidden gem books, so I definitely see myself visiting this place more often. Also, please keep in mind that the area that this store is in it has very high traffic, and I was there before 5 o'clock traffic hit"

The likes,  I liked that there was so many books and cool crafts for kids. There was a nice selection of children's books and little do it yourself crafts for them to try. Also they had journals and an eclectic jewelry selection of earrings. There are comfy chairs to sit in and they have hot coffee available.  I didn't notice any charging outlets while there,  so it may not be the best place to charge your phone or laptop.  They are part of the upcoming book crawl with other local bookstores in the area. The only thing was I wanted to sit down enjoy my coffee and read the back of the book I had picked out to guage if it was something I would want to read. I felt the employee hovered a bit and I felt uncomfortable when the employee wanted to hold the book at the front.  I wanted to sit read the back cover and enjoy the coffee. It did  lessen the book expierence for me.\nI did purchase a book I was more certain of , but  I would have liked to have felt comfortable enough and less pressured to decide if I wanted the other book or not. I'm thankful to see more bookstores in the area though and wish them success .\nBlessings,\nPr. Michelle"
