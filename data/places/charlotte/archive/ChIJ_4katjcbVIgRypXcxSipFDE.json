I was initially told at 4:45PM I'd need to wait until 5:15 when the manager was back from her break to use her code for the return. But, I used my lunch break to come do this & cannot wait or come back a different day until after the return window ends next week. The person at the register was nice & only working with the information & ability she had, but she scanned my receipt & told me it was out of the return window. I had to show her Barnes & Noble's own website, which says purchases between November 1st & December 31st are eligible for returns until January 31st. The initial response was to wait until the manager came back & shop around/she'd find me. People don't purchase items thinking \"I hope I can buy this if someone's available & not on break,\" & the same goes for returns, I never thought, \"I hope someone is available to refund the almost $40 book I bought when I show up with receipt within the return window, I hope I don't have to explain the return policy or wait 30 minutes bc only 1 person has the manager code or that returns are possible without the code.\" I offered to step aside so the line that had formed could check out & suggested asking the manager for the code, the manager provided the code, & my refund was processed after about 5-10 minutes instead of 30, but now I want to be even more careful with my book purchases & not risk having to deal with that again, so less money to B&N. The irony is I would've also probably spent 5 minutes of my break at the Starbucks & shopping around afterwards if that had just gone smoothly."

I've so far only ordered online for in-store pickup when I didn't want to wait for my indie bookstore to order something. I'm happy not to enrich Jeff Bezos with those purchases. My one complaint is that both times I've gone in, no employees were working at the front counter. Just a sign saying to go to the cafe to purchase books...Then I waited forever in line at the cafe, only to be told I needed to pick up my online order at the front counter. I then had to wait extra time for a floor employee to arrive by walkie-talkie to grab my order from the back room. It was frustrating and discouraging to order online or even make regular purchases. I don't want to wait for five drinks to be made to buy one book. You know? But still, it's a better alternative to the Online Giant."

Trust me when I tell you buying that gorgeous paper to wrap that special gift is worth it! I've done it many times and people have not forgotten how I presented their gifts. A few of my friends and family have actually saved the paper.\n\nThis store is nicely laid out!\nAlthough my son is grown, I checked out the children's area. It's a delight!\nAnd the cafe is large and well-lit.\n\nBooklovers, families, you will spend at least an hour here. Meet for play dates, besties, this will be your new hangout!\n\nCheck out my pics/videos and follow me here on Google Maps as I explore and contribute.\n\nI have a huge trip to Washington DC, coming up in mid to late May, 2024.\n\nEnjoy!\nJosephine"

A fantastic addition to the area and especially this shopping center.\n\nFor the grand opening, everyone was super helpful and looking to make sure everyone was able to find the books they were interested in. As you'd hope. However cashier Meghann was a highlight as she was very accommodating towards my elderly grandparents while totaling their mountain of cooking & coloring books.\n\nGlad to have a new bookstore in the area to check whenever the new releases I have my eye on arrive on store shelves."
