I didn't know what I wanted but knew it needed to be apple, the staff recommended the Apple Chai.  I'd never had chai before but let me tell you... It was amazing.  I found a spot in the dining room in a corner to work.  I stayed for about an hour and a half plugging away.  The atmosphere was amazing and probably the best coffee shop atmosphere I've ever been to.  I'm so grateful for this sweet family owned business.  I didn't grow up here (came here through my husbands job) but I'm SO THANKFUL for small businesses like this that treat their customers like family.  Every person that came in was greeted and honestly the guy knew them by name.  People are repeat customers because of the customer service and quality of products offered.  Thank you for making my drink today and letting me hang out for a little bit! <3"

My daughter and I go sit here when I take my son to his art class nearby, and we always have a great time.\n\nMy four stars instead of five is because the coffee is not my personal favorite. The beans are great but something about how the shots are pulled is a little off for me. Never stopped me from going though. Miles ahead of Starbucks and other chains and your latte won't break the bank. (Did I mention that the deck layout is perfect for Dino romping? I have it on good authority)."

It had insulin, I needed inside and was very important it was still inside bag when I returned for it. Your staff was very nice and I really appreciate the way they secured my bag and safely held it until my return. They handled the situation very kindly and unjudgemental as well.So please accept my deepest apologies for the 3 star rating before I didn't realize I had even given one. So please accept  the rating you and your staff deserve. I  give you guys 5  Oh, one last thing my girlfriend said the sweet tea was amazing"

Cousin Itt has never looked this good!\n\nAs for the owner and baristas? They were the kindest. Even though they were closing, they chased us down and offered us some coffee anyway. We sat outside on the patio and just had the best time.\n\nI 100% recommend stopping by and will no doubt drive 30+ minutes to experience this again."

When the owner is working, he goes out of his way to check on you and make sure you are happy. We have never had anything we didn't like, but I would bet if something were not acceptable and you were to tell him, he would bend over backwards to make it right. Nice quaint shop with interesting artwork."
