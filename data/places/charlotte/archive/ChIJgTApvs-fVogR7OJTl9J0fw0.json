Street parking is sometimes available (pay attention to towing zone signs), but the parking situation was frustrating at best and definitely put a damper on my experience.\nOnce I found a place to park, I walked in to the calming, familiar teal interior of the cafe. Baristas were... not my favorite. They weren't explicitly rude, but very cold and seemed annoyed at me questioning the menu. Asked if any sweets were dairy free, barista just shrugged. That's okay--they weren't marked, I didn't expect barista to know but a verbal response would have been appreciated.\nHowever, the biggest reason for the three stars is that NONE of the cold foam drinks can be made dairy-free. In 2023, it is ridiculous that they REFUSE to do this, even Sbux can do it for some drinks! I didn't even bother asking them to use sanitized equipment for my drink after hearing this. I got the (seasonal, I think) lavender honey latte, but did not enjoy the charge for DF milk, as other Summit locations don't have this.\nAll in all, the Plaza location is only 10 minutes away and far better than this one."
