This tasted like a disgusting off brand pre-made sourdough loaf from a Harris Teeter. NEVER AGAIN."

I have had problems with this location in the past, with some rude managers or people not taking precautions seriously. Errors on my order, such as not changing gloves or putting the wrong condiments on my sandwich, could cost my life. However, on Monday, October 24th, 2022, I had the best experience with this location. Cynthia was working in the kitchen at the time when I placed my order and I went to the take-out window to tell her my accommodations for my allergies: please change gloves, new knife as I am allergic to some breads, new cutting board, etc. She took my allergies very seriously, even telling another associate not to touch my order because of how severe my allergies are. She was very cautious and alert with my order and she made me feel completely safe. I will definitely be coming back to this location because of Cynthia and her extreme precautions with my life-threatening allergies. The only reason I am giving this location a 4-star review instead of a 5-star review is because I have had recent complications with my orders, as I am a regular customer, to which one of them I did not even eat the food due to the employees not accommodating my allergies. At that time (it has been within the past month), the manager who made my sandwich did not use a new knife while cutting my bread and did not use a new cutting board, so there was potential cross-contamination with allergens. Also, when ordering a smoothie, there was chocolate sauce on the lid (I ordered a Strawberry smoothie, so idk how chocolate sauce got on the lid) which I am not sure if I am allergic to or not. I stress my allergies every time I dine at this location, asking the employees to change their gloves, use a clean knife, a clean cutting board, and be extra cautious, but yet some employees and managers do not understand the severity of my allergies. Cythia did VERY well handling my allergies and I will definitely be requesting her assistance next time I dine in."

This does not include the orders for dinner that I order. I primarily eat Panera Bread because it is healthy, quick, and tasty. Unfortunately, this morning I ordered breakfast incorrectly at the Panera near my house vs my work. I was disappointed to learn that management was not able to make the souffles despite the hundreds of dollars a month I spend at Panera. I didn't complain when I had to wait for a different order because they were out of inventory in the morning or their being late on the order and that causing me to be late to work multiple times. But to not appreciate your customers patronage by helping with a human error. It ok I'll go to Chick Fil A where I'm greeted with a smile, known by name, and they memorize my order each morning. Food prices are getting too high for customers to deal with this."

They said you have to speak to manager but she is on the phone: I said. Can you just remake it please, lady walked away and never acknowledged me again. Waited for manager they never came. Then asked gentleman at the front if he could help get them to just remake the souffle to go. He said you have to speak to manager and 20 minutes later ended up the souffle out with not one person giving a single care.super clean establishment, humorous treatment"

EVERY table /seat or bench (there are at least 20 outdoor tables) was dirty /sticky or had crumbs or trash. The brick pavers had old food and dried up spilled drinks, various trash items, bird droppings, and everything else imaginable. I told the cashier when I ordered, and she thanked me and said \"sorry\". I cleaned a table off, myself,  (the one with the least yucky food or trash stuck on the ground) and was there for over two hours.  At NO point did anyone come to clean or check the outdoor area. And the inside was not much better. This was at a \"slow\" time. The restaurant was not at all busy and appeared to have plenty of staff. I Will NEVER eat at this location again. If the visible areas are that horrible, I can only imagine the kitchen or other places that public can't see. Disgusting. 0 stars."
