They have good coffee as well. The girls have even made me a chocolate sundae as well when I was craving icecream.  Good job on the customer service. The only advice I would say is to make sure the staff does not rush you out right at close.  This has happened to us a few times and it doesn't make you feel as welcome coming in Later."

It's light, yet full of flavor.\n\nIf you are looking for something more savory, I highly recommend their Pretzel club sandwich. The sweet combination of the Pretzel bun, combined with savory taste of the bacon and ham combined with cheddar cheese us Super delicious ."

            "review_text": "Extremely slow service for being in the drive through. Speaker was way too quiet to hear.\n\nI asked for a sugar free latte they asked if I wanted whip and I  said no. Tag on order was put in correctly so the order was at least put in right, but the drink was made wrong even after us saying no whip and no sugar 2 times before paying.\n\nWe sat in the drive through way too long for only having 2 drinks and being the only ones in line, we waited at least 10 minutes for our drinks and when the cashier came back to the window she asked us what we were waiting on, I said what we ordered and again emphasizing it was sugar free and had no whip she said it was right.\n\nAs soon as she handed it to us I noticed the whip on top so I opened my container and sure enough it was made incorrectly. By this point seeing we waited so long and the drink was wrong I just wanted my money back and to move on.\n\nI expected they were overwhelmed in the lobby which would make sense for the mix up, but when I walked in there were 0 people in line and 0 drinks being made so idk what went wrong or where the miscommunication occured.\n\nPlease retrain your people on efficiency and speed."

Obviously they want the tip but they should put out a jar like Starbucks.  They finally put the jars out but sometimes they still hold the machine out. I try to tell them to do it.  It's just annoying to me because of the angle of the car and sun etc to see try to click through the screens of rewards and tip etc. they never did that before and I wish they would stop."

It was nice to switch it up this morning and try this place since I'm working remote temporarily and it's two miles from where I live. The inside is open, warm, inviting and airy. Very nice space. I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff as I pondered over the menu. She explained the size differences and then I was ready to order. I ordered a dreamy cold brew and a bacon egg and cheese biscuit, with a side of bacon for my dog (because it would be a crime against humanity if I didn't bring him something!) I couldn't help but sneak a sip of the coffee, the cream swirled in the brew so beautifully (yes I pay attention to this because it's fun!) and it was delicious! Not too sweet, not too strong, just had a nice balance and smooth finish.\n\nCame home and got myself situated with the pup for our breakfast and the biscuit was so good! Nice and warm and as a southerner I'm impressed by the biscuit so kudos to you. Also, the bacon is pup approved (don't worry, he had very small pieces), and there's a little bit left for my husband too.\n\nI'd be ok if I worked from home more often...just saying! Will definitely be back!"

Upon searching I found Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea. I called the store to get an idea of some of their most popular items.  Josh gave me a list of some great ideas and stated that Grubhub was the delivery service that they currently use. He told me to take a look at the website and if there were items I wanted that weren't on there to give him a call back. I wanted to get them a bag of coffee to go along with their breakfast sandwiches, pastries, treats etc, but this item was not offered on Grubhub. I called back and spoke with Josh again and he stated that he would gladly help me out and could personally deliver the items to them. I could not believe it. I was shocked.  He truly went above and beyond and I will be forever grateful for him. He truly did not need to do that! He needs to be recognized."

My go to is a Chai Latte with Oat Milk, iced or hot both super amazing.\n\nThe shop is cute, decent size very clean and the employees practice all COVID guidelines. You are able to sit and dine in which is nice and there's always people grabbing coffee which is a good thing! They even have a drive-thru, which was convenient for the days I didn't want to get out of my pajamas.\n\nThe staff is beyond friendly and they are always working and helping each other out as a team, which is great to see. They are patient with the customers and seem to love their job, which is why I also like coming here now; it is a great vibe. If you're not sure what you should get, they always give great recommendations, especially when it was my first time here I was unsure. I have yet to try their pastries so on my next visit I will... thank you ladies and gentleman at SweetWaters. See you soon!"

And the Caramel Ice Dragon is essentially like a Starbucks Frappe. Again, the drinks were just so so. The pastries/desserts are where it's at!! Very impressive selection. They also have macaroons.

However, the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is due to seeing an employee the other night not take thier job seriously enough when it came to closing up and washing the floors properly. In all honesty, my preteen child actually does a better job of cleaning floors. Everyone else at closing, on the nights I've been here, does a superb job of keeping everything clean and really washing the floors. This person just barely wrung the mop out and dangled the tips of the mop head on specific areas of the floor and called it. Didn't even sweep prior. Call me meticulously crazy, but we live in a time where illness easily runs more rampant than we can blink an eye at. We need to be mindful of cleanliness everywhere we go from washing our hands constantly (which these employees do well...I watch this stuff. I used to work in the food industry.) to making sure floors are well cleaned. Daily, and sometimes more than once in the event of good spills. All this is to generally say that the overall experience at Sweetwater's is great. I just had a little issue with one employee just not owning thier part in the job they were hired to do, and it showed. Customers do notice...this one did."

What?! My sister was on the phone listening to the conversation and told me she saw it on the menu and texted a screenshot of the menu. I could tell the other two employees were mortified. The cashier said \"she is right, it's here in the cashier machine\" and the barista started complaining once again about my choice and how upset he was at Starbucks for inventing such a term. I was in total shock because of the barista's rude attitude. I told him it was on the menu and he better clarify that with someone because most likely it was going to happen again. The. the barista started complaining about working for a \"franchise\" and that was a \"franchise\" problem. I was so disappointed and mortified. I couldn't believe I suggested this place. I ordered two espressos instead. The barista made them for me. And took one of them back. I stood there waiting for my other espresso and the nice employee from the drive through gave it back to me.\n\nI wanted to support this new place but unfortunately I won't. I can't deal with rude employees who don't know anything about coffee."

My Green Tea Matcha frozen frappe was delicious! My only con was that the drink that I originally wanted to try consisted of ice cream. I was informed that due to the ice cream being frozen that it would take a while; I'd have to wait. I went through the drive-thru so I did not have time to wait today.\n\nIf I had more time, I would have waited. Their prices are no higher that the average coffee cafe/shop.

We especially love the Vietnamese Au Lait and the Napali Blend shake is heaven - the old Borders bookstore that was shut down in Stonecrest used to have the best frozen mocha coffee shake I've ever had and the Napali tops it. For food we also love their pretzel melts. With any new restaurant it usually takes a while for them to fine tune their process but these guys hit the ground impressively and have always taken our order professionally, made our drinks quickly and the drinks and food are always delicious and consistent quality. So glad we have this place a stones throw away from our house - we have happily increased our coffee budget!"

We apologized for the inconvenience. She miatakingly made it iced rather than hot. Apologized...NO NEED! We started the confusion    she made a hot soy latte and it was perfect!!! Then insisted we take the iced at no charge. This is our second visit. We have enjoyed excellent customer service both times!! Plus great coffee!!!!"
