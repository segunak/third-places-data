Very comfortable vibe whether I'm on my own or with friends.\n\nThe deli makes great sandwiches, and I especially like their breakfast options with coffee. In the refrigerated section, there's a wide selection of bottled wine, as well as 6 and 4-packs of beer. At the bar, the staff are kind and do a wonderful job - balancing giving patrons space while also being attentive. To a person, the day-to-day bartenders and staff members are superb, and I cannot say enough good things about them \n\nNot a big deal but, lately, I've noticed that the Management team has been a little micro-managey: forcing small talk with folks and bringing a 'type A' vibe. I say that to say there's a special atmosphere at Common Market - if we can, let's preserve the moment and keep commercialism/corporatism at bay \n\nCommon Market is a great community hub for the South End area with chess on Sundays, a casual book club on Wednesdays, and live music/open mic nights on most Fridays. Take your pick!"

I didn't know what to expect, but everything about this place is quite cool. The staff is friendly and helpful and I think that positive energy even translates to the overall experience and makes other customers more pleasant. I only went here for breakfast but after looking at the menu I decided to get something for lunch. The prices are comparable to Einstein brothers bagels probably cheaper but the portions are bigger and the options are a bit more unique which I like. It's nice to walk in somewhere and find something so unexpected. The decor is also really cool. I love how every where you turn there is something fun to look at or read that makes this place very unique in comparison to many of the other places surrounded by the area. It's like a market and dive bar combined with a retail store. I love it. I'll definitely be coming back and bringing some friends with me. Also they have a rewards program so that's pretty cool. Also the god is pretty good too. If you're looking for somewhere different, fun, but relaxed and somewhat nostalgic and familiar I recommend this place."

When I took it back to the point to sale the gentleman there let me know that it wasn't pork and was not helpful at all. I went and sat back down and thought about it And brought the plate back about 10 minutes later at that point the chef came out of the back  and proceeded to let me know that everyone loves his food and he'll pay money out of his own pocket to be done with me. He roughly handed me $7 He snatch the plate out of my hand walked to the back where I could see him and started to bang the plate as hard as he could against the trash.  As a food business owner and a person I would never treat any of my customers like this . I called the chef back over to the point of sale to let him know that I didn't appreciate my treatment and his reaction was uncalled for. The people that were at the common market were very nice and I love the idea of sitting outside however I would never go back there again and anyone I know will tell them this place is terrible."

You can get a quick, tasty dinner when you're HUNGRY and aren't in the mood to wait 2 hours for a table or spend a ton of money (but the deli closes earlier than the bar!). They have awesome salads - my favorites are the Cobb and the Scoop (large for a filling post-gym dinner!) I love the excellent protein choices. The salad dressings are excellent and many are homemade. The guys in the deli are always super nice even when one of us can't seem to make up our minds on what to order :-) I've only had a sandwich once - we shared a grilled BLT and that was just right for me. It definitely didn't taste healthy ;-) (Now if we can just remember to use our frequent flyer card every time...) I love that the bar has an ever rotating selection of beers and specials on Mon/Wed. It's a great place to find/try a new favorite craft beer. They bartenders are nice and let us sample so we find just the right one! The interior is interesting and fun. Overall, I love the friendly staff and the quality of the food. It's a low stress, low key, fun place to hang out."

So it was not unlike biting into a club sandwich made of 3 slices of burned toast and only a hint of egg and bacon. I keep looking all over Charlotte for a good breakfast sandwich, and I like to try the local spots hoping for something better than the chains. But this was a disappointment, especially considering how long it took to come out when we were essentially the only ones there. There is the appearance of a nice shop, but my sandwich lacked the substance I expected. This probably sounds way too critical for just a breakfast sandwich but it can't be this hard to make a good one. Nice people though and a cool location."
