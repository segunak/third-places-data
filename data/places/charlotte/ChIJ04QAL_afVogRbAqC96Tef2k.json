The raspberry tasted a little too strong. I was surprised that I could tell the frose had alcohol in it.. they weren't just frozen drinks, actually had a slight kick so felt like it was worth the price. The Italian sandwich was also pretty good. Would def come back to try other flavors and to see if they have any additional options once they get the espresso machine "
