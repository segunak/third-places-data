This place was super disappointing, low quality, and incredibly overpriced. Our breakfast sandwiches were tiny, cold, and made with a hamburger bun. My friend's gluten free option came un-toasted and we had to ask them to warm it up. The cappuccino was good. Check out the pictures attached for a better understanding of the mediocre quality of the eats!"

I believe when handling people's food, you should be extra careful to make sure things like this don't happen.

There's a reason that the latte is more expensive I was disappointed when the barista called my name for the drink I was hoping wasn't going to be my coffee. Other than this the ambiance was nice and everyone was kind but it's not fair to charge a customer for an item and assume they won't know the difference. At least the coffee was alright."

Stood and waited 5 minutes to place my order (nobody in line but they were making drinks) placed my order for a decaf pour over which they did not have so they did an Americano. With tip paid about five bucks (4$+1$) - for a shot of coffee. Honestly the most mediocre if not subpar experience I've had, but I don't know what I expected. These are the same people that were: face shields, masks, and had plastic up all at the same time while screaming for customers to do the same (Yes I literally had a lady scream at me once because I walked in the door trying to put on a mask and didn't have it all the way on - which wasn't her right to do in the first place no matter what any newscast told you). I decided to try them again after 2 years and The same experience + .005% (at least nobody yelled at me this time). Last visit ever. I'm sure they'll survive just based on the amount of disposable income in midwood but they really shouldn't. Incidentally the same person owns night swim, so I'm not even going to bother trying that place."

When I catch myself admiring their productivity it snaps me back to my own toil.  Either job applications, coursework, or if I'm lucky, just a book I'm reading.\n\nIt was during my second week sitting in this seat when one of the baristas acknowledged me for the first time.\n\n\"Do you think we're funny?\"  she asked, assuming that I had been listening in on their conversation.\n\n\"I do.\" I hadn't been listening that time, but I've listened before and watched them enough to know that they were.\n\nI've often worked in service jobs or been a patron in service environments where the staff do not particularly enjoy being around each other.  Most times it's hardly perceptible, but you can always tell when a group of employees are friends.  And it's a wonderful thing to be a part of.\n\nAnd that's what I go to Undercurrent coffee for.  The baristas will learn your name, and use it.  They'll remember your order and know what to recommend if you'd like to try something new.  But above all, they'll be really kind."

I got an iced latte in one of their glass cups and was really disappointed in the espresso to milk ratio. I could barely taste the espresso, way too milky, and just a few pieces of ice. I love that they shake the iced drinks but I didn't end up finishing mine. My husband got a cortado and it was much better than my drink. The daily quiche was fantastic and the breakfast sandwich was good but not spectacular. We sat at the bar and watched the baristas work, their flow was really fun to watch and they're very good at making drinks but someone should rethink how much milk goes into an iced latte. Not sure if it was an accident that morning or what because I've gotten iced lattes from this location (to-go) that weren't as weak."

            "review_text": "Meal: I ordered the avocado toast based on many reviews, but unfortunately, the spiced seasoning left an undesirable taste in my mouth. If you have not tried \"dukkah\" before, I would suggest you get a sample before paying $10.75 for the entree. The presentation was beautiful and the egg on top was cooked perfectly, but the spiced nuts just didn't taste good, imo. I ordered an almond milk latte, but they didn't have almond milk, so I went with the oat milk latte for a little over $5 and it was delicious!\n\nStaff: I received good service on a busy weekday at 1:30PM.\n\nSeating: There's couches and cushioned individual seats at the front, which seats about 9 people. The utensils, napkins, and water are located near the couches. There's one 4-5 seater table located next to the bar seats. A divider book shelf separates the front of the coffee shop, and there's maybe 10 more seats in the back portion near their \"lab\" and the restrooms. For a busy weekday, there were still open seats in the back portion of the shop where there's plenty of wall outlets for electronics, but I wouldn't recommend this setting for a group meeting since there aren't a lot of tables where you can face each other. They didn't have outdoor porch seating the day I came, but it is an option on other days, but those are still hard to snatch up. I recommend coming around 4PM. That was the least busiest time if you want to grab coffee and work on something real quick.\n\nParking: It's tough to find parking in this whole area. Their back parking lot has 6 spots and a handicap spot. I circled around and eventually found a spot off the street where you have to back in. For those spots, if you don't back in, it's a $25 fine just FYI.\n\nInternet: Sadly, it wasn't working the day I came. I logged into another establishment's WiFi, but it did slow me down based on productivity due to poor connection. The ambiance and music volume at the establishment was okay. It didn't interfere with me focusing. I stayed 2.5 hours, read, and worked using my phone the rest of the time.\n\nRestrooms: One of the restrooms was missing a handle, so the large hole had brown paper towel stuffed in it for privacy? The other bathroom was tidy. I would just recommend a good floor scrubbing/power wash to get the dirt off from between the tiles.\n\nThough the Internet had network issues and the food was a miss for me, I'd come again to get another drink and try a new entree."
