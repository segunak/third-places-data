            "review_text": "I've always enjoyed the food at this bakery, it's consistently good, and the small patio is a nice place to sit. However, I had a very disappointing and concerning experience that I feel needs to be shared.\n\nWhile sitting on the patio, my husband sat on a chair that turned out to be broken, and he fell. Thankfully, he wasn't seriously injured, but the situation could have been much worse, especially for an elderly person. I went inside right away and informed the young woman at the register. I told her that I had moved the broken chair to the corner to prevent anyone else from getting hurt and asked her to remove it. She didn't acknowledge me properly, didn't seem concerned at all, and just gave a cold, dismissive response.\n\nWe walked around the area and returned about 15-20 minutes later, and the broken chair was still sitting there, completely unattended. No one had come out to remove it.\n\nAt that point, I called the store and asked to speak with a manager, and the same girl answered the phone. She told me flatly, \"We don't have a manager.\" Again, no concern, no accountability.\n\nThis experience left me really disappointed. The food may be good, but the lack of basic customer service and care for customer safety is unacceptable. I sincerely hope the management (if there is any) takes this seriously and makes improvements, because it's only a matter of time before someone really gets hurt."

They needed to be heated up anyway so I have no complaints.  But can I tell you that the almond croissants tasted very much about 2 days old!!!  I've had day-old bread that was much fresher.  These things were NOT fresh and I am super unhappy about it.  This place is super cute, with great customer service...but the dry hard pastry should not be a thing.  Especially at the price point these items are being sold at.   So please do not respond by saying the pastry was fresh...because if these were fresh then there is an even bigger issue at hand, because they were dry and hard.  Like all the buttery moisture had just dissipated.  Even the almond filling was dry and brittle. Just utterly choke-worthy.  Let's do better yall!  And just to see if you guys do better, I will return and purchase the same items.  Just giving you guys a heads up because I want to sing your praises...but I will absolutely tell the truth."

Could taste coffee without bitterness. Carmel almond pastry was divine, without being filling. Caramel apple pie pastry was what you'd imagine - the flakiness of a pastry with the flavor of the pie. I liked that the shell was flaky,  but not so flaky that it crumbled all over my  clothes. I definitely will investigate one of their \"cloud cakes\" on my next visit. I'm a tightwad and I'd have no trouble buying one of those cakes, which start at $38.\n\nAmbience:  light and clean  with an interesting interpretation of stadium seating.\n\nService:  speedy if not particularly friendly. Place was busy whole time we were there, but line at register never got more than three deep even when line at pastry bar was eight deep.\n\nWork environment: a tad loud. Did not try Wi-fi, but folks were working on laptops downstairs.  I did not see any plugs.  Will definitely be back, even if it's just for a coffee."

I was so impressed I had to find a location near me here in Charlotte so I was very happy to learn Charlotte has a few locations. I live near this one so I came and checked it out on Christmas day with my sons. This was their first visit. Overall it was a very nice Christmas day treat. We all enjoyed our pastries that seem to have just the right about of sweetness in them and that's what I love most about this bakery, you don't feel guilty about indulging in a sweet treat because it's not overly sugary. They have other goodies as well that aren't sweet so if desserts aren't your thing you can still find something for you. The only thing that I don't like is they don't heat up your pastries but they do have a microwave you can use in the dining area and also my latte wasn't hot enough for me. It was like as soon as I picked it up from the counter it was already warm which is weird as I had literally picked it up as soon as she finished making it so idk if they're machine was faulty or they just don't use the hottest setting or what but when I order coffee I like it hot, I do not like cold or room temp coffee at all lol and I understand not serving it extremely hot but I should feel some kind of heat when I'm drinking it lol."

My fave, go-to beverage that they introduced me to is the Honey Lavender Macchiato  always made promptly and to my liking. Anytime there's an issue, it's resolved just as promptly and to my liking. A while back, I came in one day and hip hop music was blasting over the speakers and it really interrupted my experience and lowered the atmosphere. I reached out to let management know and to also offer more on-brand suggestions and I'm really happy to have seen them ensure that it never happens again. Today, they have some beautiful soft jazz playing at a good volume level & it's been a great visit "

The sweetness was perfectly balanced, which we appreciated since we're not fans of overly sugary pastries. The only downside was the lack of high chairs for babies. However, our little one absolutely loved the milk bread, so that made up for it! We're already looking forward to visiting again and trying more of their treats."

Her only response was--the 2 times I asked was \"do you want it hot or iced.\"\nI purchased  the drink--and didn't drink it until I got to my car--and it was not good at all. I would use the word disgusting. By the time I made it home--I was physically sick. Today's experience wasn't a pleasant one--regarding food or customer service."

My stomach is very sensitive and I had no issues what so ever. But besides that, the items I selected were so delicious, filled with amazing flavor, and just  I wish I could remember what I ordered. 3 things (Ham & Cheese, Feta & Spinach, & Something with a fruit spread n cream cheese)for like $18, which I didn't think was too shabby. So many things to choose from. THIS kind of tops Amelie's, but dare you visit and judge!!!!"

The beautiful entrance and modern, well-lit interior set the stage for an extraordinary experience the moment you walk in.\n\nAs you step inside, you're immediately greeted by a dazzling display of baked goods in well-lit cases. The sight is nothing short of mesmerizing, showcasing the bakery's incredible pastries and bread designs. It's clear that a significant amount of care and time goes into creating each intricate piece. The carving into the breads before baking results in exquisite designs that are truly a feast for the eyes once baked.\n\nThe attention to detail and craftsmanship in every item is evident, making it impossible not to admire the artistry on display. The baked goods are not only visually stunning but also mouth-wateringly delicious.\n\nMy wife and I were fascinated by our visit and were pleasantly surprised to discover such a high-quality bakery in Southpark. This bakery is now a must-visit for us whenever we are in the area for dinner. We can't wait to return for more delightful desserts.\n\nThank you so much to the Tous Les Jours team for an unforgettable experience. We look forward to many more visits!"

I told her she didn't have to give me an attitude and start moving her head. I just want my money that she owes me.\nShe turned around and said no, she didn't give me an attitude and accused me that i started it first. I told her no I didn't and I just want my money and IF she wasn't in such a rush to touch her phone and paid attention to the money I gave her then she wouldn't had messed up and I told her she needs customer service experience as she clearly DONT HAVE ANY.\nHow are you going to try to argue with a customer when YOU ARE CLEARLY in the wrong here? Her coworker told her she needed to STOP because she was clearly trying to argue that she wasn't in the wrong. She never apologized for her wrongdoing. She probably was trying to STEAL my money if I wasn't careful enough to check how much i was given back.\nYou just lost a loyal customer.\nDO NOT GO HERE."

The display cases just have to be seen and enjoyed in person even you dont do the whole \"food is art\" thing. Its the same joy of an ice creme shop with all the flavors except each flavor is an entirely different item. Willy Wonka music playing in your head and all that.  I had so many culinary questions and wanted to run around in their kitchen screaming \"wooooooooooooow neat\" but I sadly didn't have time and just didnt have out of state bail money.  Surgery was soon. The few things I grabbed would take longer than this thing will let me type to review. I'll just sum it up:  I will 100% make the 1 hour and some change drive  through a maze of school busses and SUVS to try new things in the future. I'm still drooling at the cakes on thier website.

I'm pretty adventurous, and every one of the food items I have tried I did enjoy.\n\nThey have really good drinks, both hot or iced. Unfortunately- they took off the only caffeine free drink (that actually tastes good) off the menu. I ask about it every time I go, and I do go often & year round, but they just say \"it's seasonal\".  One time I went (this was a while ago), I asked about it again, and the barista who served me on that day told me that they honestly took it off the menu because it takes a lot of effort/ time to make. I told him that it was a bummer for me cause I can't have caffeine and that drink itself was the reason I started going to TLJ regularly in the first place. He said that he knew how to make it and offered to make it for me (it was slow at the time) which was super considerate. I told him not to worry about it because (I didn't want to be annoying) but I genuinely respect taking something off the menu for a reason like that.\n\nAll of the baristas and staff are super sweet and accommodating. I've tried all their caffeine free drinks and unfortunately none of them are to my personal taste, but they have always offered to change it or refund me. I appreciate the gesture, but I think part of going out to try new things comes with the risk that you might not like what you ordered."

Caramel cheesecake was little bit over sweet. Coming to coffee, Iced tiramisu latte, vanilla latte, lavender latte and cappuccino were outstanding."

Then she went to the lady who was preparing the cake on the corner and came back said \"No, only for the Holiday cakes\". The lady in the corner turned around and look at us bluntly and went back in preparing the cake. We were shocked for a $46 cake and for just a small topper they will treat us that way. To think on Thanksgiving Eve, we bought Ube Cloud Cake and they gave us the \"Give Thanks\" topper when we asked for it. And we always buy almost $200 everytime we go there since we are 30mins away from this place.  We like their cakes and pastries so we buy a lot everytime we are there. But, this time it seems that they are not in the mood to serve their customers. We are attaching photos of cakes that we bought these recent holidays, so that you'll see that their customer service are not consistent. Anyhow, we are not coming back!"
