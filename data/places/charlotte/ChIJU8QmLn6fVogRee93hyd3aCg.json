                "review_text": "Im very familiar with actual Korean cuisine, so i had expectations. None were met.\n\nThis missed every mark. Korean x Southern fusion can be done right, this place just doesn't seem to have a clue what they're doing. The wings are good. That's about it.\n\nI can't properly rate food that is leftover, and barely reheated. Unless thats just how they do things. They shouldnt, and I can definitely tell you, it wasn't good.\n\nThe texture of the bao buns told me that the bread wasn't fresh. The meats tasted like they'd been refrigerated the night before and then reheated. Hard. Dry.\n\nEverything was cold.\nThe green tea cornbread is abhorrent. Dry, tastes nothing of Greent tea. It's just green(ish.) And full of corn pieces.\n\nThere is no doenjang in the doenjang collard greens. They gave me a bowl of unseasoned, undercooked, flavorless collards. They were absolutely horrid. Just thrown into a bowl.\n\nThe pork belly bao bun, again, cold, and hard like it was leftover from the day prior. Everything was covered in this pathetic ketchup based sauce that tased like...well, ketchup. I was expecting gochujang at the very least.\n\nWe spent the night passing plates around since our server didn't really care who ordered what, they just dumped everything on the table and left us to figure it out.\nThen at the end of our dinner, a $15 fried tilapia that no one ordered was on our bill. Odd, considering she was already getting a $40 tip in the first place. Why be greedy?\nAnyway,\nThe music is horrible, and loud.\nIf you want actual Korean cuisine do not dine here. You will be disappointed.",

We were only 11 and the room felt small I can\u2019t imagine 25 people in there. Karaoke was an ipad but the sound system was soild. Drinks and food tasted good but it was very expensive- each item is ala carte nothing comes with sides so it might be fine if you\u2019re a smaller group and can share but if you\u2019re a larger one you will spend a lot more. Get there early because parking is hard to find. Our server did check on us frequently which we appreciated.",

No, this is a hymn\u2014nay, a divine psalm\u2014dedicated to the angel incarnate who calls herself Wendy the Waitress.\n\nWendy did not walk to our table. She glided, suspended half an inch above the floor, as if gravity itself was too humbled to burden her. Her smile\u2014dear reader, her smile\u2014was so radiant that my friend Greg, a lifelong cynic, wept openly and has since joined a monastery.\n\n\u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d she asked, her voice somehow both a gentle mountain breeze and the final note of a Chopin nocturne. I was not ready. How could I be? The mere act of speaking to Wendy felt like trying to recite poetry to a comet.",

There are ride on animals that are a cool concept but the system used to rent them is a little chaotic. I sat in line and was skipped over. A designated area for riding like a track would be a good idea as some kids ended up in the parking lot or mowing down smaller children. The food was mid, and overpriced. I would recommend for drinks and an appetizer if you have kids.l love the concept of including parent needs when dining/socializing. Some of the play areas were a little run down, but that didn't bother the kids too much. I like the ability to go between food halls and Seoul. The outdoor space could benefit from more shaded seating but overall it was a pleasant experience.",

The plastic silverware felt like we were still in the middle of covid, the first food took around 45min to get to us, and the rest of it was lukewarm and just okay.  Guessing you need to be drinking heavily to enjoy the food.  I won\u2019t go back but maybe i should have tried the wings?  Oh, and the waitress could rarely be found, but probably not her fault because i think she was also working behind the bar.",

My group of four people visited in-person to inquire about karaoke reservations, and booked a slot while standing in the lobby of restaurant for the $30/hour Country Room next day. While the employee was walking us through the reservation process, at no point did they explain that the $20 non-refundable deposit does not go towards the room rental. This information was hidden in the small print, and I understand that it was my responsibility to check that as a customer. However, the receipt (attached below) stated that my remaining balance when I reached the restaurant would be $10, which is what I thought I owed to the restaurant after our karaoke session given the room was $30/hour. Additionally, this is information that the employee should have stated while we were standing in front of them making a reservation.\n\nWe arrived for our reservation, and it took 10 minutes for our \u2018karaoke machine\u2019 to be set up, which is really an iPad casting YouTube karaoke videos to a TV with speakers and mics. We had to go out multiple times to find an employee to get the volume of the TV and mics turned up, and even then the mics were not good quality.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating that the time spent setting up was not deducted from our 1 hour, and that we unknowingly ended up paying $52.00 for this experience when we could\u2019ve just watched YouTube karaoke videos at home for free.",

What\u2019s worse is the fact that we came in the day before to reserve the room and was told the total would be $30. When we went to pay at the end, we should\u2019ve paid $10 since we paid $20 the day before to hold the room. They added an ADDITIONAL $30 to the charge a for a total of $50 even though the site never  said that the $20 doesn\u2019t go towards the $30 room.

We put our $20 deposit down and got a receipt saying we have a remaining balance of $10 afterwards. We went in for our booked karaoke session and the room we booked is not prepped at all. Employees spend 15 minutes of our paid session to set up the TV and speakers. This establishment just pulls up karaoke videos from YouTube on a TV. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST DO THIS AT HOME ITS THE SAME THING. On top of that, they\u2019ll scam you at the end and ask for an additional $30 for the room. In total, we paid $50 for a subpar karaoke setup and didn\u2019t even get a full hour session that we paid since they took so long to set up even after being verbally and in writing (on the website) told it would only be $30. This place is extremely deceiving and a borderline scam",

The server ignored them and when we tried to flag him down to arrange more seats, he walked away. I had to pull an extra table and grab chairs for my friends.\n\nThen, the staff messed up our food by bringing a dish none of us ordered. The fried chicken was slathered in so much sauce---we could barely taste the meat. The tacos were atrocious and the bao buns were dull. On the other hand, the server gave everyone iced water without asking our beverage preferences.\n\nAfter the meal was over, it took him forever to complete everyone's check. Most of us had to grab our own takeout boxes for leftovers. He consistently lingered at the bar and hardly ever returned. Having enough of this serious lack of responsibility, I headed to the checkout and asked the hostess for my bill. I settled the payment there and left the restaurant. You can never pay me to dine there ever again.",

I think a little extra sauce on the side for the soy garlic wings would have been nice.  The gochujang sauce on the other wings were good though.\n\nThe pork belly bao buns were disappointing, the meat was cold and chewy.  They would have been perfect if they were cooked to order and hot.\n\nThe kimchi bulgogi kimbap, was\u2026  It was like eating day old leftovers straight from the fridge and the bulgogi had a weird texture, like dried tofu that had been reconstituted with not enough water.\n\nI really hope that this isn\u2019t the norm and that this restaurant can get better at executing the menu to its full potential.\n\nWith that said, the service was excellent.  My husband and I were greeted by the lovely staff as soon as we walked in. Our server took the time to answer any questions and was super sweet.",

It's not like it's super busy because they have time to chat to each other. Also, it took them a loong time giving my side, when I have finished the main dish already. They don't seem to be sorry at all. Super poooor service. Not going back at all. Me and my friends left soooo disappointed.",

I can\u2019t express that enough, bone in wings are perfect. Owners are still set in their way with no changes to any menu items and you can not ask for extra sauce. I still remember the day they got my drink order wrong and it was my fault. Maybe one day this place will get better. But we will have to wait for new management\n\n\u201cTwo years later, I came back\u2026 The Yuzu cocktail I love is now $18\u2026 Sad\u2026 Learned the reason the bartender from two years ago gave me so much trouble was because management charges the bartenders for miss orders and over pouring\u2026 More sad\u2026 Management bad\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t order mix drinks from here, if they accidentally use soda water instead of sprite and you request another one they will tell you \u201cWe are all trained to make drinks the same way, we can get you another drink but you will be changed for it\u201d. So yea they messed up my Yuzu drink and told me they didn\u2019t mess it up and they would not make me another one.",

We ordered about $100 worth of food and drinks unfortunately one of the drinks we had my partner was allergic to and the bartender decided to offer a different drink. The MANAGER shortly after decided to hound out the bartender about the drink in front of us. That alone made us feel super uncomfortable to enjoy our food. I still decided to continue to eat my food. My wings were very very dry and I had asked the cooks for more sauce in which there was ton of communication between them as if they have been ordered to not offer more wing sauce because of cost. I then asked for one of their pre packaged sauces in which they had to discuss further before the trying to provide me with packed ketchup because that indeed was the cheapest sauce they had. I wouldn\u2019t have mind paying the difference. This was at their church street location.\n\nTHE MANAGER the decided to walk up and approach me behind my back. He then tried to make it seem as if there was a problem for asking for sauce. I informed him with consideration of paying close to $100 I didn\u2019t understand why asking for honestly anything that night was a problem. He then went on to say he didn\u2019t have to get sauce and that I could leave which was before we could even eat our food. I then asked for a refund because we couldn\u2019t eat our food in which he RAISED his voice to say no and that I\u2019d have no luck even if I tried to dispute with the transaction. He then walked away into his office and slammed the door on us in front of ALL the staff and the customers that were there.\n\nIn conclusion, he was pissed because I guess he felt they lost a total of $3.25 that night for remaking the drink and the providing a sauce when instead he now has lost $100 in total because of his horrible hospitality that didn\u2019t exist and horrible customer service. Imagine telling your employees to penny nickle and dime with the 10 customers they had come in that night and now he himself has lost the company $100.\n\nHe never walked up to even ask if we were having a good experience in which that alone I would probably came back 3 more times after meaning they could\u2019ve made $400 of me.\n\nGood luck explaining to the owners how now you they\u2019re -$100 and you\u2019re losing more money than the employees here he suppose to manage and report to him.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE. UNPROFESSIONAL. IRATE. DEMEANING. CHEAPSKATE. = Manager",

                "review_text": "I went to Seoul Food Meat Company after reading the reviews and it seemed like a decent restaurant with many reviews but I made the mistake of not reading the latest reviews and that's where I got got! When I walked into Seoul Food Meat Company, the restaurant was entirely empty except for the bar tender and a person who seemed to be the owner. He didn't necessarily greet me but more so gave me the menus and told me and my family that we could sit wherever. OKay!\n\nTo be fully transparent, I had my mind set on going to Ruby Sunshine which is right across the street and I truly should've followed my intuitions but I didn't. So back to Seoul Food, the menus is simple, straightforward the food items seemed to be good. We placed our orders with the bartender who seemed to not truly care about us or our order. It was difficult to understand her, not due to language barrier but because she talked so low and the restaurant is empty.\n\nWhen we got out food, I can say I was disappointed with the taste, the presentation and the temperature of the food. I read Saniqua P's review that said \"I feel like Seoul is that person you knew in school who so desperately wanted to be part of the \"cool\" crowd but their efforts always felt a tad forced.\" I definitely felt that and it's true. Seoul Food to me is trying to fit into a segment that doesn't fit them or vice versa and it shows.\n\nWith the lack of customer service, the slow service, and the food being disappointing, I have learned and will not be coming back, but since the business doesn't read the comments, I know it doesn't matter anyway! I recommend you try another place that is true to the cuisine and appreciates the customers.",

They have tons of space, a great selection of Korean comfort food, and drinks. We had the sweet and spicy chicken wings and they were one of the best wings I\u2019ve ever had. I will definitely come back to try more of their stuff.",

When we got to the place, we were told that all reservations were cancelled for that night, but they mistakenly forgot to disable our time slot from being able to make the reservation. This made our $20 reservation invalid. They then told us that we could still rent a room if we wanted. So if you see our reservation and you have rooms open, why was it such a hassle to fulfill our reservation? On top of that, when we rented the room, you charged us an additional $30 for the time. The total cost should have been $45, and somehow, because of your mistakes, we had to pay $50? It's not the money, it's the principle. The mistake was on your end, but we some how end up paying more. Then, the kitchen is closed because of a party; prioritizing other guests. Your business' actions show a lack of transparency, management and the fact you all tried to avoid the conversation of refund or compensation, for a mistake made by the business, demonstrates dishonesty or incompetency. Either way, it's a disaster. Do better.",

There\u2019s no reason to not play Korean music especially with so many collabs and English songs now. Moving on\u2026 great variety on soju flavors. Menu options remain unique and varied. I love the fusion between Korean and Southern food. Haven\u2019t moved out of town, I was so excited to visit. I am hoping this was an off day. The flavor of 3 out of 4 dishes was muted. It just wasn\u2019t good. The fried chicken had great soy garlic flavor, but was not fully cooked. Management took care of it and brought me a new batch. Perfect. One money of the party had an allergy. The manger couldn\u2019t answer what oil was used to fry the chicken. He didn\u2019t attempt to find out. I suppose the risk of anaphylactic shock was acceptable. I had to get up and ask one of the kitchen staff myself. I think they need actual Korean cooks in the kitchen and a little training about dangerous food allergies. I\u2019m sorry to even be writing this review.",

The karaoke control system was super frustrating to use (huge remote, Korean letters, laborious clicking of buttons) and half the songs just cut off in the middle. The layout of my K-Pop-themed room was awkward with long benches and narrow space for people. If you\u2019re vegetarian, none of the entrees were able to be made veggie. They do have a yummy appetizer dish made with tofu but that was it.\n\nOverall, we had fun but I couldn\u2019t honestly recommend doing what we did bc of the issues I mentioned. They did discount some of our bill bc of the TV so that was nice.",

We had about 18 people in the room and they did not attend to us very well at all.  They didnt bus our tables so trays of food piled up all night...we had to request for them to be removed.  Our server barely checked in on us and drinks were very slow to get to us.  Many of us had to leave the room to order drinks from the bar and even then, drinks were very slow to get to us.  Although we still managed to have a good time we were all very disappointed with the customer service here.  The food was not to bad, I enjoyed it but others in our party did not.  We will probably not return.",

I\u2019d say it\u2019s more like southern BBQ and Korean food under the same umbrella.\n\nAs there are many options of meat, it\u2019s hard to choose one. So me and my friends chose different thing\u2019s and tried each others meat. I ended up ordering the brisket, but that was the downfall. Maybe it was because it was later at night, the brisket ended up drier than I expected. The beef rib was for sure good as well as the crispy pork belly. The Ramen Mac and Cheese was pretty interesting. It\u2019s just another random vessel to get cheese into your mouth.\n\nThe service was pretty chill where they call your order up and you just pick it up. Nothing too fancy. They also have a bar for you if you want to pick up a drink separate from your food while you wait.\n\nThe location was pretty chill as there is a lot of space. We had a lot of people so we were able to sit all of us without being separated.",

I have been ordering and recommending seoul food for over 5 years, even after moving almost 30 minutes away I was happy to drive for what used to be my favorite foot spot\u2014that promptly ends today.\n\nI waited 10 minutes before even being acknowledged at the door, after being ignored (not missed, ignored) by the bussgirl 3 times as she rearranged menus in front of me. I\u2019d normally chalk that up to a busy friday night, except for the fact that I was the only person at the door, all the tables were empty and clean, and the other 7 or so people in the building were all at the bar, being helped by the bartender. After being helped by another bartender (they removed all their servers because the owner doesn\u2019t want to pay them, according to a former employee) I picked up my togo order and went home. That was my second mistake.\n\nNot only was my order wrong, chicken chunks with fractured bones instead of wings, the sauce was forgotten by the kitchen. I called them and asked what was going on, and was told to hold for a manager who didn\u2019t show up. The same employee that answered the phone told me that \u201cordered the wrong thing\u201d and that \u201cthe kitchen said they added the sauce, it probably soaked into the wings and you didn\u2019t notice\u201d. Ah, my dry wings simply drank the sauce! Maybe that\u2019s where it grew the bone chunks from!\n\nOh, and then she hung up after acting like she \u201ccouldn\u2019t hear me anymore\u201d. This business has fallen apart, and I\u2019d sooner order from the dumpster across the street before I order from here ever again. A total waste of $50.",

They have a bunch of employees is in the back just standing around I am not sure what they even do. The poor hostess had to take our order as we were so confused when we first walked in and weren\u2019t greeted by someone once we sat down. I ordered the \u201csmoked\u201d brisket bao bun. It was tiny, unseasoned and DRY. The ram and cheese had no flavor. It\u2019s literal just ramen noodles in a dried up cheese sauce topped off with melted cheese. Their instagram practically catfished me because it looks so delicious online. Wings are good but nothing that screams wow especially given the fact that Korean food is known for their fried chicken. It\u2019s overpriced and the atmosphere sucks. What\u2019s the point in opening a restaurant like this? I would never come back again. Just know you have to pay before you eat and if you want sauces it\u2019s extra $$$. Might as well just be a take out place instead of a whole restaurant. It\u2019s lazy and sad.",

If you want some authentic Korean food, I would say skip this place, but if you just want a place to eat, then this is an okay choice, if a little pricy. Dishes are more focused on pictures than taste, aside from the kimbap which I actually very much enjoyed! This might all be from the food options I chose (fire chicken, dirty white rice, bao buns, kimchi Mac and cheese, and the bulgogi kimchi kimbap) but it definitely was not as hyped as it claims to seem.

The squid kimbap was disgustingly grainy, slimy, and completely inedible. I have had squid and kimbap in the past and enjoyed it. Total let down.   The mac and cheese was a joke\u2014it tasted like plain spaghetti noodles mixed with the cheapest canned chili imaginable, with zero kimchi flavor.\n\nThe boneless chicken was another disaster. It was so rock-hard that I couldn't even put a fork through it, and to top it off, it had the wrong sauce. We were forced to throw out the entire meal because it was just that bad.\n\nAdding to the frustration, I called the restaurant five times to complain, but no one bothered to answer. This experience was a huge letdown, especially since we've had fantastic meals at their other location before.\n\nUnless these issues are addressed and corrected, we will never be returning. If the matter is resolved satisfactorily, I might consider updating this review, but for now, it stands as a warning to others.\n\nUpdate: Finally spoke to someone on the phone. I was  told that you have to email all concerns and nothing can be addressed over the phone. I was also told that a refund cannot be guaranteed. I am happy to change my review if I get a response and matters are addressed.",

For reference, current prices (07/13/2024) of my favorite BBQ place in DC (I live in DC area):\nMeats:\nbeef brisket: $13.39, pulled pork: $9.39, pulled chicken: $8.99, two meats: $13.39, baby back ribs: $14, smoked salmon: $15.74, ...\nSides:\nBaked beans with bacon: $3.14, cold slaw: $2.99, fresh cut fries: $3.04, potato salad: $3.24, mac-n-cheese: $3.19, ...",

The room had one of the Korean machines (which tends to be popular at karaoke bars) but it was severely lacking in options compared to every other karaoke machine I've seen, even the Korean ones. The tablet was slow, there was no way to connect a third party app or device, and by far the worst part was the horrible selection of songs. If you searched up any famous artist you may know, they MIGHT have their 4th and 5th most popular songs, but never the most famous ones. A lot of our searches returned no results, and it's not like we had niche songs, we searched across a variety of genres. There were no results for Panic at the Disco, Nine Inch Nails, or Men at Work (which I would consider rather famous groups) and only a couple songs from groups like System of a Down, The Killers, Green Day, etc.\n\nI would NOT recommend coming here for karaoke unless you plan on singing Korean songs. I would also NOT come here for the bar as it was pricey and generic (2 shots of house tequila for $30, a rum and coke for $15).",

I spoke with the manager and he was really apologetic for her behavior. While speaking with the manager she still tried to go back and forth with me. The food was okay definitely not traditional Korean food more American. The wing were extremely large and the best sauce was the soy garlic all of the other sauces were extremely overbearing on the wings. If you\u2019ve ever visited Korea or had authentic Korean food this isn\u2019t the best restaurant for Korean food. The beef ribs are American beef ribs not the Korean Kalbi. The pork belly is good and crispy. The atmosphere was good I love the food hall atmosphere. There is an outside eating area with a play ground for children.

Immediately when we walked into the building it seemed like the staff was just annoyed at our presence for no reason, and I wasn\u2019t the only person in the group who got that vibe. They also failed to tell me that I had to get this parking app in order to be reimbursed for parking, so I paid $8 to park in their lot. No big deal, but they also kept my ID as a deposit and forgot to give it back after the session. To be fair, I also forgot they took it but I wish they could have said something when I paid for my drinks before I left. I live out of town so I still haven\u2019t been able to get my drivers license back and nobody ever responded to any of my calls or emails. It\u2019s been about a month. As for the actual karaoke, this is probably the worst KTV place I\u2019ve been to while also being the most expensive. The rooms aren\u2019t sound proof and the whole time we could hear other parties singing (loudly and badly) over our songs. Also the room was extremely hot and there were no fans available. After reading the other reviews it seems that their AC has been broken since February. The karaoke machine was all in Korean, which is not uncommon since most KTV places use Asian karaoke machines, but they usually also have a separate device or a way to connect your phone to let you navigate with an English system and give you a greater song selection. I\u2019m not sure if Charlotte has any better KTV options (a real shame if they didn\u2019t), but this place just didn\u2019t do it for me. It\u2019s not worth the price\u2014especially with the additional reservation fee, the parking fee, the automatic service fee, and my drivers license.",

I ordered the bulgogi kimbap, bulgogi kimchi kimbap, and the sweet and mild boneless wings. The kimbap was pretty solid. The kimchi didn't have much flavor, but I would say the regular bulgogi kimbap was my favorite. The meat was flavorful and there was a nice hint of acidity from the pickled veggies. The wings were interesting. It was a mix of dark meat and maybe white meat but they were definitely huge and not traditional wings. I think these might actually be thighs because I have never seen wings this big. They were good, but if I came back, I would stick to the kimbap. Otherwise, a cool spot in the area to eat and catch up with friends.",

The room is supposed to fit 25 people max which MAY be possible if no one orders food, but it was IMPOSSIBLE with no A/C, therefore half of our group just stayed outside by the bar which defeated the purpose of me paying $100/hr for my group of 22.\n\nService: Although the servers themselves were very kind, it took forever for anyone to check on us for additional drink/food orders, they kept forgetting to bring our drinks and they didn\u2019t clear away our food after eating!\n\nThe food: TERRIBLE.\n\nLuckily my group was just happy to be all together celebrating so we made it work, but I will NEVER return. Hopefully this review helps someone before reserving for a large group!",

When we arrived, we learned that the air conditioner in the rooms had been broken since February (it\u2019s now May). Had I known this detail, I would have booked another location but that little tidbit was withheld. They provided us a large fan which moved the stuffy hot air somewhat around the room. Others that booked similar rooms left but we remained in the sweat lodge.\n\nFood was good despite not having a full menu. Service is good. I think the server knew every party would be frustrated by A/C.\n\nGood news: despite the lack of A/C, they still charged the full fee and did not credit the deposit on the bill.",

                "review_text": "My extended family rented one of the karaoke rooms for a couple hours and also ordered food and beverages. The food was pretty average. Who serves bao buns with no filling?\n\nBut the big problem was the horrible karaoke service. Since that was why we went there, it was a real bummer.\n\n1. It was 30 minutes into our 2 hr reservation before the staff member even got the karaoke up and running. Not acceptable.\n2. Guests CANNOT control the volume of the music or the volume of the microphones. This meant that when the backing sound went completely out on two different occasions, we had to sit around and wait for someone to come and unlock the cabinet to adjust it, and then we were stuck with whatever volume they left it set to.\n3. The selection kinda sucks. Seems like they were missing a lot of standard karaoke fare.\n4. The control technology was awful. There is only one tablet. Many of the buttons on the tablet didn't work and most were labelled in Korean. Heaven forbid if we wanted to raise or lower the key. Setting up a queue was nearly impossible. Searching for a song was a ponderous task similar to the dreaded entering of a long password by scrolling to and clicking on the keyboard on a smart TV. And if the tablet wasn't aimed right at the karaoke equipment stack, it didn't work at all. Honestly, it felt like equipment from 2005.\n5. Why in the world did I have to pay a reservation fee THAT DOES NOT GO TO THE ROOM RENTAL COST?\n\nOverall, this was a very poor experience and a bummer for me because I had really encouraged my family to give private karaoke a try. I did get the manager to refund 30 minutes of our time, but they should have refunded the whole karaoke fee. Save your money and buy a home karaoke machine for the same cost, with a vast library and easy controls.",

This incident occurred on a Saturday evening when my son (50M) and I (83M) stopped by for dinner on our way home from the stadium. We approached the counter, placed our orders for different meals, my son's beer, and my soda pop, paid, and sat down to wait for our food.\n\nAfter a considerable wait (about 20 minutes), the waitress informed us that they were out of both meals we had ordered. She suggested we review the menu, but our second and third choices were also unavailable. They only had chicken wings and pulled pork left.\n\nAt this point, we realized that there was nothing on the menu that we wanted to eat, so we politely asked for a refund to go elsewhere. The waitress called her manager, who promptly refused our request, insisting that we order something they had available. We reiterated that there was nothing on the menu that we desired. We questioned why they charged us when they didn't have the food we ordered.\n\nEventually, the manager agreed to refund the cost of the food, but not the beer my son had ordered. My son argued that he had barely touched half a glass, and I had not even touched my soda pop. The manager begrudgingly agreed to refund 50% of the beer charge, which we paid before leaving. To make matters worse, the counterperson then loudly and rudely demanded that we leave, denying me the receipt to validate the refund.\n\nI am someone who has lived long enough to not let small inconveniences bother me, but this experience was embarrassing and disappointing. I hope that Seoul Food takes this as an opportunity for self-reflection and strives to improve their customer service.",

Would really hope that they would at least admit their fault and apologize so other customer's clothes don't suffer the same fate.\nAlso should probably wipe down the chair as part of your cleaning process.",

The only unfortunate thing was that their Internet wasn't working so there would be moments of silence, however, this issue was solved. It had a modern feel but not the type of bland modern that you see within houses, it was more of a just updated atmosphere. You choose where you sit (nobody seats you) and you go to the bar to order.

I pay to go to a restaurant so my food will be prepared perfectly and served to me. That way, all I have to do is eat. That being said, for an honest review. The staff was very attentive and helpful with any questions I had and checked on me frequently. The atmosphere was inviting and exactly what you would expect, and the place was very clean. Now for the food. First,  they bring you lots of it. For the money you won't go hungry. It's almost too much for a patron eating by himself. Absolutely no problems there. For me personally,  it was hard trying to get the food cooked perfectly. The solid sirloin was the easiest to cook because it came out as 1 piece. The ribeye is rolled up, and they give you lots of it. Definitely share that entre, but it was hard to get a perfect cook because it was sliced so thin. The shrimp were a nice size, and the chicken was tasty except for the fact that it was hard to tell if done. If you have friends or family that like this kind of stuff, then this place is fantastic. It's much better than that place where you throw your food in boiling water. I'm just not a fan of working for my meal. So in conclusion, if I was into work, then I would definitely go here again. (Or friends that wanted to go) I would definitely recommend this place, but know what you are getting into.",

They said no menu modifications, so we asked what was in the menu items. They told us his food ingredients in the items he wanted and confirmed no eggs/cheese and then they came out with it very much having them they then told us we couldn't get a refund or get alternative food instead (even though they don't even know what in their food and work there every day). They then said we'd have to pay for more food to replace even though they don't know the menu/ingredients. HOW RUDE like zero customer service?! It was a girl with reddish hue hair and glasses lunch shift 1/13/24. I cannot get over this I've been working in restaurants forever and would never do this. GET THIS they didn't even show us the NO EGG NO CHEESE MENU that EXISTED!!! Was going to have company event here over 1K budget, but not anymore. Will go somewhere less stingy/more knowledgeable with better service. I just said sure just charge me at this point not worth it, but it kinda ruined my mood.",

They have karaoke rooms you have to pay for per hour, so that is meh. But we still had a good time doing karaoke. It was just expensive; I recommend just buying a little karaoke machine and using your phone at home with family and friends.

When she finally decided to come up to me I was not acknowledge by any means. she continued to rummage around the host stand until I told her I was here for a carry out order. She proceeded to say nothing to me and handed me the wrong order, then took it back and slammed the correct bag on the counter and walked away. She clearly has not been trained properly in customer service. I hope managment is able to recognize this and help her reel in the unnecessary attitude because it makes the resultant look awful as a whole. Food is good though.",

We had drinks and dined in. He was delighted with the Tilapia and I ordered a beef rib, slaw and corn. Unable to eat the hearty portion I wrapped the rest.  At about midnight my stomach turned and I had diarrhea for over 24 Hours.  The Seoul Meat Company meal is all I had eaten since Coffee and Egg for breakfast.  I contacted the restaurant to return the food and report my experience. Bobby, was the day Manager and he  told me that he would inform Adam, the Manager who handles these matters. After two days I called again and was told by Bobby that Adam had called me three times.  I never received a call or message from Adam. After two weeks I called  during the evening when Adam is on duty and was told by him that I ignored his calls and that he would issue a gift card for the sides. I questioned why and was told that I didn't have to bring back the rib. Adam lacks customer service skills and the acumen to handle such matters. I asked him to refer my issue to the owner and he told me to Google and email him.  Adam was rude, crude and obnoxious. The service has always been delightful and I have enjoyed the food until this experience. HOPEFULLY TIM WILL READ THIS REVIEW VONTACT ME AND COACH ADAM ON CUSTOMER RELATION INTERACTION.",

My husband and I have loved Seoul Food in the past and continuously bring people who visit from out of town.\n\nWe decided to head over to the Urban Market location last Friday night. It was pretty dead inside and we ordered some pork belly, the soy garlic wings and some elote corn. They have increased prices substantially but I figure their rent is high in this area. Our issue is the the soy garlic wings, which we've had many times before, they were super dry, there was almost no sauce on them. We asked nicely if we could have a little extra sauce and they absolutely refused...when I pay a ridiculous amount for wings and you hand me dry ones, it makes no sense to not give the customer a little sauce. They did offer me other sauces that they had sitting out though like hot sauce and bbq sauce...if you've ever had these wings, you would not want this on them, they are soy garlic!!! Never in my life have I experienced such terrible customer service. I am not sure we will ever return to either location after this experience. Saving a few cents on sauce to lose customers, nice job.\n\nOther small issues, the line to order makes no sense at this location. The elote corn was not good, it was the first time we had gotten it however, it was caked in too much dry cheese and has some sad amount of tajin spice on it.",

We walked in the door and waited awkwardly for the employees to finish their conversation. Then once they had finished, they asked if we wanted drink menus, handed them to us, and stood there expectantly. I told them we hadn\u2019t been here before and I was told \u2018sit anywhere and you just order at the bar when you\u2019re ready\u2019 then they went back to their conversation. I asked if they validated parking and was told \u2018we give you a code before you leave\u2019. After ordering at the bar, we were given a buzzer (but not told what it was or where to pick up the food) and as we were walking away, the host said \u2018I need your card\u2019 to have us pay before being seated - despite the general restaurant setup that suggested otherwise. Eventually, the host brought the validation code to our table but didn\u2019t explain that the code can only be entered using ParkMobile app which I didn\u2019t have. I ended up paying for parking using the ParkMobile website.  The whole experience was confusing, the service was nonexistent (maybe that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be?), the food was average but overpriced. The first thing I did as we left was apologize to my friend and ask her if she wanted to stop by the Chik Fil A near my house. She said yes.",

Then you have to go get it with your drink from a designated pick-up area. I tested the broccoli and cucumber salad with hot chili paste. They were both ok, but the nod goes to the ladder... It can get crowded if a large party comes in, but they did have some outside seating.  Parking can be tight at this location(Church St.) when events and football are going on at the stadium.

We noted that the service model has shifted to a more self-sufficient approach, with customers placing orders at the counter and refilling their own beverages. Staff members are responsible for delivering food to the table. The cuisine remains exceptional, with standout dishes including the crispy pork belly and beef ribs. Other menu items may appeal to more adventurous palates. Parking can be challenging, and it may be necessary to seek street parking further from the restaurant. Despite this minor inconvenience, we will certainly return for the outstanding food.",

Somehow my order got confused to Kimichi fries with chicken. No big deal, I went back to the bar and asked them to fix it. The bartender directed me to a male, light skinned manager (he wouldn\u2019t tell me his name so all I have is a description) who proceeded to not only call me a liar about what I ordered, but cussed at me for trying to get the order fixed. I first asked just to return the food that was incorrect and have it fixed, he refused and got mad when I tried to ask how that was fair. He just kept saying \u201cit was made, so you have to eat it\u201d. Never heard that one before. Then I asked to have a refund because my friends and I just wanted to leave at that point and the food was still sitting on the counter untouched. Again he started cussing at me and said that he wasn\u2019t going to refund food that was made and I could either eat it or leave it. I then asked for a box so I could just leave, and he refused to even do that. Another employee was kind enough to get me one. I recorded the whole thing and had planned to post it, but Seoul Food as a whole doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished for one horrible manager. Completely inappropriate and rude behavior. Coming from a General manager of almost 10 years, this man should not be in charge of any respectable establishment. On a positive note, the chicken kimchi fries were actually good.",

The philly egg rolls were not fully cooked and was nothing but meat and cheese. Why mustard sauce accompaniment?\nWings were gigantic! Soy garlic was mostly soy flavored, maybe add some minced garlic. The crunch was on point though. The sweet and mild was HEAVY on the siracha. YUCK! Siracha and sweet was a no buena for me. The best thing we ordered was the brisket bulgogi taco. It was borderline salty but compared to the other food, we dealt with it.\nOverall, the experience was subpar and I wound up at Captain D\u2019s for a piece of fish because I was still hungry after that $40 disappointment. I don\u2019t think I will be back but I appreciate the effort.\nI wish you some improvement and success.",

I got the sweet and mild wings and they were very good but emphasis on the sweet so if you don\u2019t like sweet stuff I wouldn\u2019t get that. I also got a beef brisket taco which was also very good and had a sweet taste as well. I will say, the food was good and the service was fast, but the food came out room temperature. If it was hot this would definitely be a 4.5 out of 5",

Korean x Southern fusion can be done right, this place just doesn't seem to have a clue what they're doing. The wings are good. That's about it.\n\nI can't properly rate food that is leftover, and barely reheated. Unless thats just how they do things. They shouldnt, and I can definitely tell you, it wasn't good.\n\nThe texture of the bao buns told me that the bread wasn't fresh. The meats tasted like they'd been refrigerated the night before and then reheated. Hard. Dry.\n\nEverything was cold.\nThe green tea cornbread is abhorrent. Dry, tastes nothing of Greent tea. It's just green(ish.) And full of corn pieces.\n\nThere is no doenjang in the doenjang collard greens. They gave me a bowl of unseasoned, undercooked, flavorless collards. They were absolutely horrid. Just thrown into a bowl.\n\nThe pork belly bao bun, again, cold, and hard like it was leftover from the day prior. Everything was covered in this pathetic ketchup based sauce that tased like...well, ketchup. I was expecting gochujang at the very least.\n\nWe spent the night passing plates around since our server didn't really care who ordered what, they just dumped everything on the table and left us to figure it out.\nThen at the end of our dinner, a $15 fried tilapia that no one ordered was on our bill. Odd, considering she was already getting a $40 tip in the first place. Why be greedy?\nAnyway,\nThe music is horrible, and loud.\nIf you want actual Korean cuisine do not dine here. You will be disappointed.",

Drinks and food tasted good but it was very expensive- each item is ala carte nothing comes with sides so it might be fine if you\u2019re a smaller group and can share but if you\u2019re a larger one you will spend a lot more.

No, this is a hymn\u2014nay, a divine psalm\u2014dedicated to the angel incarnate who calls herself Wendy the Waitress.\n\nWendy did not walk to our table. She glided, suspended half an inch above the floor, as if gravity itself was too humbled to burden her. Her smile\u2014dear reader, her smile\u2014was so radiant that my friend Greg, a lifelong cynic, wept openly and has since joined a monastery.\n\n\u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d she asked, her voice somehow both a gentle mountain breeze and the final note of a Chopin nocturne. I was not ready. How could I be? The mere act of speaking to Wendy felt like trying to recite poetry to a comet.",

There are ride on animals that are a cool concept but the system used to rent them is a little chaotic. I sat in line and was skipped over. A designated area for riding like a track would be a good idea as some kids ended up in the parking lot or mowing down smaller children. The food was mid, and overpriced. I would recommend for drinks and an appetizer if you have kids.l love the concept of including parent needs when dining/socializing. Some of the play areas were a little run down, but that didn't bother the kids too much. I like the ability to go between food halls and Seoul. The outdoor space could benefit from more shaded seating but overall it was a pleasant experience.",

The plastic silverware felt like we were still in the middle of covid, the first food took around 45min to get to us, and the rest of it was lukewarm and just okay.  Guessing you need to be drinking heavily to enjoy the food.  I won\u2019t go back but maybe i should have tried the wings?  Oh, and the waitress could rarely be found, but probably not her fault because i think she was also working behind the bar.",

My group of four people visited in-person to inquire about karaoke reservations, and booked a slot while standing in the lobby of restaurant for the $30/hour Country Room next day. While the employee was walking us through the reservation process, at no point did they explain that the $20 non-refundable deposit does not go towards the room rental. This information was hidden in the small print, and I understand that it was my responsibility to check that as a customer. However, the receipt (attached below) stated that my remaining balance when I reached the restaurant would be $10, which is what I thought I owed to the restaurant after our karaoke session given the room was $30/hour. Additionally, this is information that the employee should have stated while we were standing in front of them making a reservation.\n\nWe arrived for our reservation, and it took 10 minutes for our \u2018karaoke machine\u2019 to be set up, which is really an iPad casting YouTube karaoke videos to a TV with speakers and mics. We had to go out multiple times to find an employee to get the volume of the TV and mics turned up, and even then the mics were not good quality.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating that the time spent setting up was not deducted from our 1 hour, and that we unknowingly ended up paying $52.00 for this experience when we could\u2019ve just watched YouTube karaoke videos at home for free.",

By the time we started it had been 20 mins and we were still told our time is up after one hour since checking in. What\u2019s worse is the fact that we came in the day before to reserve the room and was told the total would be $30. When we went to pay at the end, we should\u2019ve paid $10 since we paid $20 the day before to hold the room. They added an ADDITIONAL $30 to the charge a for a total of $50 even though the site never  said that the $20 doesn\u2019t go towards the $30 room. Overall very unhapt with the experience and management who didn\u2019t seem to think the charge was an issue",

Employees spend 15 minutes of our paid session to set up the TV and speakers. This establishment just pulls up karaoke videos from YouTube on a TV. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST DO THIS AT HOME ITS THE SAME THING. On top of that, they\u2019ll scam you at the end and ask for an additional $30 for the room. In total, we paid $50 for a subpar karaoke setup and didn\u2019t even get a full hour session that we paid since they took so long to set up even after being verbally and in writing (on the website) told it would only be $30.

The server ignored them and when we tried to flag him down to arrange more seats, he walked away. I had to pull an extra table and grab chairs for my friends.\n\nThen, the staff messed up our food by bringing a dish none of us ordered. The fried chicken was slathered in so much sauce---we could barely taste the meat. The tacos were atrocious and the bao buns were dull. On the other hand, the server gave everyone iced water without asking our beverage preferences.\n\nAfter the meal was over, it took him forever to complete everyone's check. Most of us had to grab our own takeout boxes for leftovers. He consistently lingered at the bar and hardly ever returned. Having enough of this serious lack of responsibility, I headed to the checkout and asked the hostess for my bill. I settled the payment there and left the restaurant. You can never pay me to dine there ever again.",

I think a little extra sauce on the side for the soy garlic wings would have been nice.  The gochujang sauce on the other wings were good though.\n\nThe pork belly bao buns were disappointing, the meat was cold and chewy.  They would have been perfect if they were cooked to order and hot.\n\nThe kimchi bulgogi kimbap, was\u2026  It was like eating day old leftovers straight from the fridge and the bulgogi had a weird texture, like dried tofu that had been reconstituted with not enough water.\n\nI really hope that this isn\u2019t the norm and that this restaurant can get better at executing the menu to its full potential.\n\nWith that said, the service was excellent.  My husband and I were greeted by the lovely staff as soon as we walked in. Our server took the time to answer any questions and was super sweet.",

Maybe one day this place will get better. But we will have to wait for new management\n\n\u201cTwo years later, I came back\u2026 The Yuzu cocktail I love is now $18\u2026 Sad\u2026 Learned the reason the bartender from two years ago gave me so much trouble was because management charges the bartenders for miss orders and over pouring\u2026 More sad\u2026 Management bad\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t order mix drinks from here, if they accidentally use soda water instead of sprite and you request another one they will tell you \u201cWe are all trained to make drinks the same way, we can get you another drink but you will be changed for it\u201d.

We ordered about $100 worth of food and drinks unfortunately one of the drinks we had my partner was allergic to and the bartender decided to offer a different drink. The MANAGER shortly after decided to hound out the bartender about the drink in front of us. That alone made us feel super uncomfortable to enjoy our food. I still decided to continue to eat my food. My wings were very very dry and I had asked the cooks for more sauce in which there was ton of communication between them as if they have been ordered to not offer more wing sauce because of cost. I then asked for one of their pre packaged sauces in which they had to discuss further before the trying to provide me with packed ketchup because that indeed was the cheapest sauce they had. I wouldn\u2019t have mind paying the difference. This was at their church street location.\n\nTHE MANAGER the decided to walk up and approach me behind my back. He then tried to make it seem as if there was a problem for asking for sauce. I informed him with consideration of paying close to $100 I didn\u2019t understand why asking for honestly anything that night was a problem. He then went on to say he didn\u2019t have to get sauce and that I could leave which was before we could even eat our food. I then asked for a refund because we couldn\u2019t eat our food in which he RAISED his voice to say no and that I\u2019d have no luck even if I tried to dispute with the transaction. He then walked away into his office and slammed the door on us in front of ALL the staff and the customers that were there.\n\nIn conclusion, he was pissed because I guess he felt they lost a total of $3.25 that night for remaking the drink and the providing a sauce when instead he now has lost $100 in total because of his horrible hospitality that didn\u2019t exist and horrible customer service. Imagine telling your employees to penny nickle and dime with the 10 customers they had come in that night and now he himself has lost the company $100.\n\nHe never walked up to even ask if we were having a good experience in which that alone I would probably came back 3 more times after meaning they could\u2019ve made $400 of me.\n\nGood luck explaining to the owners how now you they\u2019re -$100 and you\u2019re losing more money than the employees here he suppose to manage and report to him.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE. UNPROFESSIONAL. IRATE. DEMEANING. CHEAPSKATE. = Manager",

When I walked into Seoul Food Meat Company, the restaurant was entirely empty except for the bar tender and a person who seemed to be the owner. He didn't necessarily greet me but more so gave me the menus and told me and my family that we could sit wherever. OKay!\n\nTo be fully transparent, I had my mind set on going to Ruby Sunshine which is right across the street and I truly should've followed my intuitions but I didn't. So back to Seoul Food, the menus is simple, straightforward the food items seemed to be good. We placed our orders with the bartender who seemed to not truly care about us or our order. It was difficult to understand her, not due to language barrier but because she talked so low and the restaurant is empty.\n\nWhen we got out food, I can say I was disappointed with the taste, the presentation and the temperature of the food. I read Saniqua P's review that said \"I feel like Seoul is that person you knew in school who so desperately wanted to be part of the \"cool\" crowd but their efforts always felt a tad forced.\" I definitely felt that and it's true. Seoul Food to me is trying to fit into a segment that doesn't fit them or vice versa and it shows.\n\nWith the lack of customer service, the slow service, and the food being disappointing, I have learned and will not be coming back, but since the business doesn't read the comments, I know it doesn't matter anyway! I recommend you try another place that is true to the cuisine and appreciates the customers.",

When we got to the place, we were told that all reservations were cancelled for that night, but they mistakenly forgot to disable our time slot from being able to make the reservation. This made our $20 reservation invalid. They then told us that we could still rent a room if we wanted. So if you see our reservation and you have rooms open, why was it such a hassle to fulfill our reservation? On top of that, when we rented the room, you charged us an additional $30 for the time. The total cost should have been $45, and somehow, because of your mistakes, we had to pay $50? It's not the money, it's the principle. The mistake was on your end, but we some how end up paying more. Then, the kitchen is closed because of a party; prioritizing other guests. Your business' actions show a lack of transparency, management and the fact you all tried to avoid the conversation of refund or compensation, for a mistake made by the business, demonstrates dishonesty or incompetency. Either way, it's a disaster. Do better.",

There\u2019s no reason to not play Korean music especially with so many collabs and English songs now. Moving on\u2026 great variety on soju flavors. Menu options remain unique and varied. I love the fusion between Korean and Southern food. Haven\u2019t moved out of town, I was so excited to visit. I am hoping this was an off day. The flavor of 3 out of 4 dishes was muted. It just wasn\u2019t good. The fried chicken had great soy garlic flavor, but was not fully cooked. Management took care of it and brought me a new batch. Perfect. One money of the party had an allergy. The manger couldn\u2019t answer what oil was used to fry the chicken. He didn\u2019t attempt to find out. I suppose the risk of anaphylactic shock was acceptable. I had to get up and ask one of the kitchen staff myself. I think they need actual Korean cooks in the kitchen and a little training about dangerous food allergies. I\u2019m sorry to even be writing this review.",

DJ in the main restaurant was great and we had fun dancing. Service was decent.\n\nCons: the main TV for my karaoke room was broken and the staff couldn\u2019t get it to work. The karaoke control system was super frustrating to use (huge remote, Korean letters, laborious clicking of buttons) and half the songs just cut off in the middle. The layout of my K-Pop-themed room was awkward with long benches and narrow space for people. If you\u2019re vegetarian, none of the entrees were able to be made veggie. They do have a yummy appetizer dish made with tofu but that was it.\n\nOverall, we had fun but I couldn\u2019t honestly recommend doing what we did bc of the issues I mentioned. They did discount some of our bill bc of the TV so that was nice.",

Our server barely checked in on us and drinks were very slow to get to us.  Many of us had to leave the room to order drinks from the bar and even then, drinks were very slow to get to us.  Although we still managed to have a good time we were all very disappointed with the customer service here.  The food was not to bad, I enjoyed it but others in our party did not.

The other service person in the back just looked at his phone, not even lifting his head to acknowledge our existence. We waited for a while, then we just got up and left.

I\u2019d say it\u2019s more like southern BBQ and Korean food under the same umbrella.\n\nAs there are many options of meat, it\u2019s hard to choose one. So me and my friends chose different thing\u2019s and tried each others meat. I ended up ordering the brisket, but that was the downfall. Maybe it was because it was later at night, the brisket ended up drier than I expected. The beef rib was for sure good as well as the crispy pork belly. The Ramen Mac and Cheese was pretty interesting. It\u2019s just another random vessel to get cheese into your mouth.\n\nThe service was pretty chill where they call your order up and you just pick it up. Nothing too fancy. They also have a bar for you if you want to pick up a drink separate from your food while you wait.\n\nThe location was pretty chill as there is a lot of space. We had a lot of people so we were able to sit all of us without being separated.",

I have been ordering and recommending seoul food for over 5 years, even after moving almost 30 minutes away I was happy to drive for what used to be my favorite foot spot\u2014that promptly ends today.\n\nI waited 10 minutes before even being acknowledged at the door, after being ignored (not missed, ignored) by the bussgirl 3 times as she rearranged menus in front of me. I\u2019d normally chalk that up to a busy friday night, except for the fact that I was the only person at the door, all the tables were empty and clean, and the other 7 or so people in the building were all at the bar, being helped by the bartender. After being helped by another bartender (they removed all their servers because the owner doesn\u2019t want to pay them, according to a former employee) I picked up my togo order and went home. That was my second mistake.\n\nNot only was my order wrong, chicken chunks with fractured bones instead of wings, the sauce was forgotten by the kitchen. I called them and asked what was going on, and was told to hold for a manager who didn\u2019t show up. The same employee that answered the phone told me that \u201cordered the wrong thing\u201d and that \u201cthe kitchen said they added the sauce, it probably soaked into the wings and you didn\u2019t notice\u201d. Ah, my dry wings simply drank the sauce! Maybe that\u2019s where it grew the bone chunks from!\n\nOh, and then she hung up after acting like she \u201ccouldn\u2019t hear me anymore\u201d. This business has fallen apart, and I\u2019d sooner order from the dumpster across the street before I order from here ever again. A total waste of $50.",

It was tiny, unseasoned and DRY. The ram and cheese had no flavor. It\u2019s literal just ramen noodles in a dried up cheese sauce topped off with melted cheese. Their instagram practically catfished me because it looks so delicious online. Wings are good but nothing that screams wow especially given the fact that Korean food is known for their fried chicken. It\u2019s overpriced and the atmosphere sucks. What\u2019s the point in opening a restaurant like this? I would never come back again. Just know you have to pay before you eat and if you want sauces it\u2019s extra $$$. Might as well just be a take out place instead of a whole restaurant. It\u2019s lazy and sad.",

Dishes are more focused on pictures than taste, aside from the kimbap which I actually very much enjoyed! This might all be from the food options I chose (fire chicken, dirty white rice, bao buns, kimchi Mac and cheese, and the bulgogi kimchi kimbap) but it definitely was not as hyped as it claims to seem.

The squid kimbap was disgustingly grainy, slimy, and completely inedible. I have had squid and kimbap in the past and enjoyed it. Total let down.   The mac and cheese was a joke\u2014it tasted like plain spaghetti noodles mixed with the cheapest canned chili imaginable, with zero kimchi flavor.\n\nThe boneless chicken was another disaster. It was so rock-hard that I couldn't even put a fork through it, and to top it off, it had the wrong sauce. We were forced to throw out the entire meal because it was just that bad.\n\nAdding to the frustration, I called the restaurant five times to complain, but no one bothered to answer. This experience was a huge letdown, especially since we've had fantastic meals at their other location before.\n\nUnless these issues are addressed and corrected, we will never be returning. If the matter is resolved satisfactorily, I might consider updating this review, but for now, it stands as a warning to others.\n\nUpdate: Finally spoke to someone on the phone. I was  told that you have to email all concerns and nothing can be addressed over the phone. I was also told that a refund cannot be guaranteed. I am happy to change my review if I get a response and matters are addressed.",

The place did not feel anything special, and for what the place and service looked like, the food here is significantly overpriced. You can find the same dishes in more expensive northern cities for nearly half the price. It's hard to tell if this is due to hype, a lack of competition, or both, but it feels like a rip-off. For reference, current prices (07/13/2024) of my favorite BBQ place in DC (I live in DC area):\nMeats:\nbeef brisket: $13.39, pulled pork: $9.39, pulled chicken: $8.99, two meats: $13.39, baby back ribs: $14, smoked salmon: $15.74, ...\nSides:\nBaked beans with bacon: $3.14, cold slaw: $2.99, fresh cut fries: $3.04, potato salad: $3.24, mac-n-cheese: $3.19, ...",

The room had one of the Korean machines (which tends to be popular at karaoke bars) but it was severely lacking in options compared to every other karaoke machine I've seen, even the Korean ones. The tablet was slow, there was no way to connect a third party app or device, and by far the worst part was the horrible selection of songs. If you searched up any famous artist you may know, they MIGHT have their 4th and 5th most popular songs, but never the most famous ones. A lot of our searches returned no results, and it's not like we had niche songs, we searched across a variety of genres. There were no results for Panic at the Disco, Nine Inch Nails, or Men at Work (which I would consider rather famous groups) and only a couple songs from groups like System of a Down, The Killers, Green Day, etc.\n\nI would NOT recommend coming here for karaoke unless you plan on singing Korean songs. I would also NOT come here for the bar as it was pricey and generic (2 shots of house tequila for $30, a rum and coke for $15).",

I spoke with the manager and he was really apologetic for her behavior. While speaking with the manager she still tried to go back and forth with me. The food was okay definitely not traditional Korean food more American. The wing were extremely large and the best sauce was the soy garlic all of the other sauces were extremely overbearing on the wings. If you\u2019ve ever visited Korea or had authentic Korean food this isn\u2019t the best restaurant for Korean food. The beef ribs are American beef ribs not the Korean Kalbi. The pork belly is good and crispy. The atmosphere was good I love the food hall atmosphere. There is an outside eating area with a play ground for children. Overall, the atmosphere was the best part of our experience at this establishment.",

Immediately when we walked into the building it seemed like the staff was just annoyed at our presence for no reason, and I wasn\u2019t the only person in the group who got that vibe. They also failed to tell me that I had to get this parking app in order to be reimbursed for parking, so I paid $8 to park in their lot. No big deal, but they also kept my ID as a deposit and forgot to give it back after the session. To be fair, I also forgot they took it but I wish they could have said something when I paid for my drinks before I left. I live out of town so I still haven\u2019t been able to get my drivers license back and nobody ever responded to any of my calls or emails. It\u2019s been about a month. As for the actual karaoke, this is probably the worst KTV place I\u2019ve been to while also being the most expensive. The rooms aren\u2019t sound proof and the whole time we could hear other parties singing (loudly and badly) over our songs. Also the room was extremely hot and there were no fans available. After reading the other reviews it seems that their AC has been broken since February. The karaoke machine was all in Korean, which is not uncommon since most KTV places use Asian karaoke machines, but they usually also have a separate device or a way to connect your phone to let you navigate with an English system and give you a greater song selection. I\u2019m not sure if Charlotte has any better KTV options (a real shame if they didn\u2019t), but this place just didn\u2019t do it for me. It\u2019s not worth the price\u2014especially with the additional reservation fee, the parking fee, the automatic service fee, and my drivers license.",

They have validated parking which is a huge plus and a decent seating area for bigger groups. I ordered the bulgogi kimbap, bulgogi kimchi kimbap, and the sweet and mild boneless wings. The kimbap was pretty solid. The kimchi didn't have much flavor, but I would say the regular bulgogi kimbap was my favorite. The meat was flavorful and there was a nice hint of acidity from the pickled veggies. The wings were interesting. It was a mix of dark meat and maybe white meat but they were definitely huge and not traditional wings. I think these might actually be thighs because I have never seen wings this big. They were good, but if I came back, I would stick to the kimbap. Otherwise, a cool spot in the area to eat and catch up with friends.",

The room is supposed to fit 25 people max which MAY be possible if no one orders food, but it was IMPOSSIBLE with no A/C, therefore half of our group just stayed outside by the bar which defeated the purpose of me paying $100/hr for my group of 22.\n\nService: Although the servers themselves were very kind, it took forever for anyone to check on us for additional drink/food orders, they kept forgetting to bring our drinks and they didn\u2019t clear away our food after eating!\n\nThe food: TERRIBLE.\n\nLuckily my group was just happy to be all together celebrating so we made it work, but I will NEVER return.

When we arrived, we learned that the air conditioner in the rooms had been broken since February (it\u2019s now May). Had I known this detail, I would have booked another location but that little tidbit was withheld. They provided us a large fan which moved the stuffy hot air somewhat around the room. Others that booked similar rooms left but we remained in the sweat lodge.\n\nFood was good despite not having a full menu. Service is good. I think the server knew every party would be frustrated by A/C.\n\nGood news: despite the lack of A/C, they still charged the full fee and did not credit the deposit on the bill.",

                    "review_text": "My extended family rented one of the karaoke rooms for a couple hours and also ordered food and beverages. The food was pretty average. Who serves bao buns with no filling?\n\nBut the big problem was the horrible karaoke service. Since that was why we went there, it was a real bummer.\n\n1. It was 30 minutes into our 2 hr reservation before the staff member even got the karaoke up and running. Not acceptable.\n2. Guests CANNOT control the volume of the music or the volume of the microphones. This meant that when the backing sound went completely out on two different occasions, we had to sit around and wait for someone to come and unlock the cabinet to adjust it, and then we were stuck with whatever volume they left it set to.\n3. The selection kinda sucks. Seems like they were missing a lot of standard karaoke fare.\n4. The control technology was awful. There is only one tablet. Many of the buttons on the tablet didn't work and most were labelled in Korean. Heaven forbid if we wanted to raise or lower the key. Setting up a queue was nearly impossible. Searching for a song was a ponderous task similar to the dreaded entering of a long password by scrolling to and clicking on the keyboard on a smart TV. And if the tablet wasn't aimed right at the karaoke equipment stack, it didn't work at all. Honestly, it felt like equipment from 2005.\n5. Why in the world did I have to pay a reservation fee THAT DOES NOT GO TO THE ROOM RENTAL COST?\n\nOverall, this was a very poor experience and a bummer for me because I had really encouraged my family to give private karaoke a try. I did get the manager to refund 30 minutes of our time, but they should have refunded the whole karaoke fee. Save your money and buy a home karaoke machine for the same cost, with a vast library and easy controls.",

This incident occurred on a Saturday evening when my son (50M) and I (83M) stopped by for dinner on our way home from the stadium. We approached the counter, placed our orders for different meals, my son's beer, and my soda pop, paid, and sat down to wait for our food.\n\nAfter a considerable wait (about 20 minutes), the waitress informed us that they were out of both meals we had ordered. She suggested we review the menu, but our second and third choices were also unavailable. They only had chicken wings and pulled pork left.\n\nAt this point, we realized that there was nothing on the menu that we wanted to eat, so we politely asked for a refund to go elsewhere. The waitress called her manager, who promptly refused our request, insisting that we order something they had available. We reiterated that there was nothing on the menu that we desired. We questioned why they charged us when they didn't have the food we ordered.\n\nEventually, the manager agreed to refund the cost of the food, but not the beer my son had ordered. My son argued that he had barely touched half a glass, and I had not even touched my soda pop. The manager begrudgingly agreed to refund 50% of the beer charge, which we paid before leaving. To make matters worse, the counterperson then loudly and rudely demanded that we leave, denying me the receipt to validate the refund.\n\nI am someone who has lived long enough to not let small inconveniences bother me, but this experience was embarrassing and disappointing. I hope that Seoul Food takes this as an opportunity for self-reflection and strives to improve their customer service.",

Would really hope that they would at least admit their fault and apologize so other customer's clothes don't suffer the same fate.\nAlso should probably wipe down the chair as part of your cleaning process.",

The only unfortunate thing was that their Internet wasn't working so there would be moments of silence, however, this issue was solved. It had a modern feel but not the type of bland modern that you see within houses, it was more of a just updated atmosphere. You choose where you sit (nobody seats you) and you go to the bar to order. Overall, I will be coming here again, hopefully, they're able to reopen soon \ud83d\ude4f",

I pay to go to a restaurant so my food will be prepared perfectly and served to me. That way, all I have to do is eat. That being said, for an honest review. The staff was very attentive and helpful with any questions I had and checked on me frequently. The atmosphere was inviting and exactly what you would expect, and the place was very clean. Now for the food. First,  they bring you lots of it. For the money you won't go hungry. It's almost too much for a patron eating by himself. Absolutely no problems there. For me personally,  it was hard trying to get the food cooked perfectly. The solid sirloin was the easiest to cook because it came out as 1 piece. The ribeye is rolled up, and they give you lots of it. Definitely share that entre, but it was hard to get a perfect cook because it was sliced so thin. The shrimp were a nice size, and the chicken was tasty except for the fact that it was hard to tell if done. If you have friends or family that like this kind of stuff, then this place is fantastic. It's much better than that place where you throw your food in boiling water. I'm just not a fan of working for my meal. So in conclusion, if I was into work, then I would definitely go here again. (Or friends that wanted to go) I would definitely recommend this place, but know what you are getting into.",

They said no menu modifications, so we asked what was in the menu items. They told us his food ingredients in the items he wanted and confirmed no eggs/cheese and then they came out with it very much having them they then told us we couldn't get a refund or get alternative food instead (even though they don't even know what in their food and work there every day). They then said we'd have to pay for more food to replace even though they don't know the menu/ingredients. HOW RUDE like zero customer service?! It was a girl with reddish hue hair and glasses lunch shift 1/13/24. I cannot get over this I've been working in restaurants forever and would never do this. GET THIS they didn't even show us the NO EGG NO CHEESE MENU that EXISTED!!! Was going to have company event here over 1K budget, but not anymore. Will go somewhere less stingy/more knowledgeable with better service. I just said sure just charge me at this point not worth it, but it kinda ruined my mood.",

They have karaoke rooms you have to pay for per hour, so that is meh. But we still had a good time doing karaoke. It was just expensive; I recommend just buying a little karaoke machine and using your phone at home with family and friends.

She proceeded to say nothing to me and handed me the wrong order, then took it back and slammed the correct bag on the counter and walked away.

The expiration time was 9:25, the car was towed at 9:29.\nWhy are we paying hundreds of dollars at a restaurant that allows for this to happen. I completely understand towing on a weekend or even Thursday and Friday. That area is notorious for people parking and walking other bars and events, but on a Monday\u2026.they\u2019re going to allow this to happen at their establishment.\nHonestly even if our cars hadn\u2019t been towed, it\u2019s not good enough to have gone back.",

We had drinks and dined in. He was delighted with the Tilapia and I ordered a beef rib, slaw and corn. Unable to eat the hearty portion I wrapped the rest.  At about midnight my stomach turned and I had diarrhea for over 24 Hours.  The Seoul Meat Company meal is all I had eaten since Coffee and Egg for breakfast.  I contacted the restaurant to return the food and report my experience. Bobby, was the day Manager and he  told me that he would inform Adam, the Manager who handles these matters. After two days I called again and was told by Bobby that Adam had called me three times.  I never received a call or message from Adam. After two weeks I called  during the evening when Adam is on duty and was told by him that I ignored his calls and that he would issue a gift card for the sides. I questioned why and was told that I didn't have to bring back the rib. Adam lacks customer service skills and the acumen to handle such matters. I asked him to refer my issue to the owner and he told me to Google and email him.  Adam was rude, crude and obnoxious. The service has always been delightful and I have enjoyed the food until this experience. HOPEFULLY TIM WILL READ THIS REVIEW VONTACT ME AND COACH ADAM ON CUSTOMER RELATION INTERACTION.",

My husband and I have loved Seoul Food in the past and continuously bring people who visit from out of town.\n\nWe decided to head over to the Urban Market location last Friday night. It was pretty dead inside and we ordered some pork belly, the soy garlic wings and some elote corn. They have increased prices substantially but I figure their rent is high in this area. Our issue is the the soy garlic wings, which we've had many times before, they were super dry, there was almost no sauce on them. We asked nicely if we could have a little extra sauce and they absolutely refused...when I pay a ridiculous amount for wings and you hand me dry ones, it makes no sense to not give the customer a little sauce. They did offer me other sauces that they had sitting out though like hot sauce and bbq sauce...if you've ever had these wings, you would not want this on them, they are soy garlic!!! Never in my life have I experienced such terrible customer service. I am not sure we will ever return to either location after this experience. Saving a few cents on sauce to lose customers, nice job.\n\nOther small issues, the line to order makes no sense at this location. The elote corn was not good, it was the first time we had gotten it however, it was caked in too much dry cheese and has some sad amount of tajin spice on it.",

I should have chosen better. We walked in the door and waited awkwardly for the employees to finish their conversation. Then once they had finished, they asked if we wanted drink menus, handed them to us, and stood there expectantly. I told them we hadn\u2019t been here before and I was told \u2018sit anywhere and you just order at the bar when you\u2019re ready\u2019 then they went back to their conversation. I asked if they validated parking and was told \u2018we give you a code before you leave\u2019. After ordering at the bar, we were given a buzzer (but not told what it was or where to pick up the food) and as we were walking away, the host said \u2018I need your card\u2019 to have us pay before being seated - despite the general restaurant setup that suggested otherwise. Eventually, the host brought the validation code to our table but didn\u2019t explain that the code can only be entered using ParkMobile app which I didn\u2019t have. I ended up paying for parking using the ParkMobile website.  The whole experience was confusing, the service was nonexistent (maybe that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be?), the food was average but overpriced. The first thing I did as we left was apologize to my friend and ask her if she wanted to stop by the Chik Fil A near my house. She said yes.",

I had kimchee fries (beef) and a large order of wings (spicy bbq and soy garlic- I liked these better!).  You order at the bar and then have a seat until your meal buzzer goes off.  Then you have to go get it with your drink from a designated pick-up area. I tested the broccoli and cucumber salad with hot chili paste. They were both ok, but the nod goes to the ladder... It can get crowded if a large party comes in, but they did have some outside seating.  Parking can be tight at this location(Church St.) when events and football are going on at the stadium. Overall I will come again!",

We noted that the service model has shifted to a more self-sufficient approach, with customers placing orders at the counter and refilling their own beverages. Staff members are responsible for delivering food to the table. The cuisine remains exceptional, with standout dishes including the crispy pork belly and beef ribs. Other menu items may appeal to more adventurous palates. Parking can be challenging, and it may be necessary to seek street parking further from the restaurant. Despite this minor inconvenience, we will certainly return for the outstanding food.",

Somehow my order got confused to Kimichi fries with chicken. No big deal, I went back to the bar and asked them to fix it. The bartender directed me to a male, light skinned manager (he wouldn\u2019t tell me his name so all I have is a description) who proceeded to not only call me a liar about what I ordered, but cussed at me for trying to get the order fixed. I first asked just to return the food that was incorrect and have it fixed, he refused and got mad when I tried to ask how that was fair. He just kept saying \u201cit was made, so you have to eat it\u201d. Never heard that one before. Then I asked to have a refund because my friends and I just wanted to leave at that point and the food was still sitting on the counter untouched. Again he started cussing at me and said that he wasn\u2019t going to refund food that was made and I could either eat it or leave it. I then asked for a box so I could just leave, and he refused to even do that. Another employee was kind enough to get me one. I recorded the whole thing and had planned to post it, but Seoul Food as a whole doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished for one horrible manager. Completely inappropriate and rude behavior. Coming from a General manager of almost 10 years, this man should not be in charge of any respectable establishment. On a positive note, the chicken kimchi fries were actually good.",

The philly egg rolls were not fully cooked and was nothing but meat and cheese. Why mustard sauce accompaniment?\nWings were gigantic! Soy garlic was mostly soy flavored, maybe add some minced garlic. The crunch was on point though. The sweet and mild was HEAVY on the siracha. YUCK! Siracha and sweet was a no buena for me. The best thing we ordered was the brisket bulgogi taco. It was borderline salty but compared to the other food, we dealt with it.\nOverall, the experience was subpar and I wound up at Captain D\u2019s for a piece of fish because I was still hungry after that $40 disappointment. I don\u2019t think I will be back but I appreciate the effort.\nI wish you some improvement and success.",
