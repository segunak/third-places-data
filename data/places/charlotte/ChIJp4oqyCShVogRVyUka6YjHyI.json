They made it so easy to enjoy fresh, locally roasted coffee from the comfort of home, and their personal touch in every order made me feel like more than just a customer.\n\nEven now, I continue to support Enderly Coffee because they consistently provide amazing coffee and a great mission behind their business.

The coffee is fantastic, full of flavor, hot and bold my favorite brew was Ethiopia, (the drip coffee changes daily but they were all good. Always 2 choices) The people, love and happiness in the building is off the charts! I don't think I would have survived the intense training and being away from home without the kindness that was shared. They did not know how much it meant to me. But walking in and having someone say hello Cindy, how are you meant the world. I was not just another customer. They made me feel welcome.  Everyone that comes in the door is welcome.  Just thinking about the place puts a smile on my face.  My heart will always smile when I think about the time studying at Enderly and the amazing people. Thank you Chelle, Kemoy, Taylor and Tony for the friendship and that magically coffee that got me through the 8pm-3am simulator shift. Thank you for helping me reach my dreams.. You were all a part of my story. To anyone wondering if they should stop by and grab a coffee... the answer is YES... every cup made with love..."

I cannot overstate how committed this company is to its customers and its community. The outstanding product is just the cherry on top. Tony and team have made lifetime customers out of us (and any friend of mine who will listen).\n\n----original review below----\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been ordering coffee from Enderly Coffee Company for almost a year. Our espresso machine has held nothing but Enderly beans since we moved to Charlotte, and we are slowly making our way through every kind of bean they offer for our daily coffee. Their Friday home delivery is such an excellent service--every time I run low on beans, I just hop on and pick a new bag to be dropped off at my doorstep for free that Friday--and every time we've been in the shop we are just so pleased by the kindness of those behind the counter. Tony Santoro has personally helped me skip subscription orders if I'm not going through beans as fast and he even helped me exchange a shirt I bought without even having to come in the shop. There are always new treats from local places popping up for Friday delivery and we love checking them out. I'm just so happy a place like this exists in my community and I'm excited to continue to drink Enderly Coffee for years to come."

I know this from eavesdropping, though, because, me? I'm always sure of what I want. I'm boring - but the drinks here aren't.\n\nEnderly Coffee Co. is quite vibey. It's full of art and locally made merch such as stone mugs and the like. It's perfect for catching up with friends, a coffee date, or for studying. It can't really accommodate big groups so plan accordingly.\n\nParking is available behind the building but please note that the lot is small. It's definitely a community gem in an area that is rapidly being gentrified. Somehow, Enderly still feels very Charlotte despite all that's changing in the neighborhood.\n\nI hope you enjoy it!"

Location is weird too as it is right on a very busy street with several mechanic/car mod businesses across the street and if you're sitting outside, forget having a conversation because every couple of minutes a car/motorcycle/four-wheeler takes off with full acceleration and modified exhausts that blast your eardrums. The particular staff member we encountered was not rude, per se, but definitely seemed a bit annoyed about something and was curt in his responses. I had an iced vanilla latte with oat milk and my friend had an Americano, which I had no complaints about. Don't expect much in the way of eats. The croissant was good enough and the chocolate cookie was ok, but there were literally one of each left and nothing else (we arrived an hour before closing time). Overall, I would probably not go back because there are much closer places to home with better hours and same, if not better, quality coffee."

Coming here I was very impressed by the coffee and now feel kind of sad I won't be able to try them again.  This is definitely a pretty impressive new shop and better than most any roaster I have had in Nashville.  I am from the Pacific Northwest, lived in Denver and have ordered coffees from around the country, including from California, Missouri, Illinois and New York.  I have had an appreciation for some of the best roasters in the country and I will say this stuff impressed me.  If they end up shipping and nitrogen packing their bags I may consider ordering some of this stuff.   Also, they charge very little for the quality of the coffee.   I think some of the snobby shops in Seattle could learn a thing or two about high quality and modest pricing like this shop has.   Definitely a very good micro-roaster.  I would put them and Hex at the top of roasters I have had in Charlotte."

They've got a selection of healthy and more decadent snacks to accompany their excellent coffee.  The Americano was strong and honest.  I look forward to trying their sombucha kombucha and some of their fall specialty drinks when it starts FEELING like fall up in this place.\n\nAll in all, the vibe is what's going to make this my new go-to for coffee.  The music's present but not overwhelming.  Fast internet.  And a place where the barista made the effort right away to know my name, ask a few questions about who I am and where I live, and get me set up for that dark elixir of life that keeps me from hatin' on people when they don't use their noggins.\n\nGood folks, good products, good prices.  Solid."

It was the only coffee shop in the area and located in an area that has been known to be sketchy.  We were absolutely blown away by how great this place is.  The building and decor are well designed the interior is spacious well decorated.  We loved the musically inspired art and theme #thisishowwebrewit. The vibe and ambiance is everything we would want to have in a local coffee shop.  Tacoby was our barista and we enjoyed the drinks as well as the conversation.  We were able to setup office for a few hours and get things done.  We wish we had Enderly out in Cornelius, NC!  We will be back whenever on that end of Charlotte."
