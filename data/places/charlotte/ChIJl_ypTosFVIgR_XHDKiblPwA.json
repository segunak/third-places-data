Atmosphere is lovely. Decor is local artist gallery space, a wonderful idea. Food is amazing. Baked Brie with Apples, Bacon, and Pecans appetizer is a delicious start. Harvest Flatbread has a great balance of Sweet (apples) and salty (blue cheese crumble.) Lobster Bisque soup of the day is a great contender.  And of course, the Three Cheese Grilled Cheese is beautiful. Stretchy and a good mix of cheeses. All in all, a definite place to try if you're local, and a nice place to try if you're stopping in. Big Daddy G is a great chef, and thanks for the conversation with a couple of wandering Canucks. (The food looked and smelled so good we didn't have time to take a photo until halfway done...lol.)"

Both sandwiches were great! We also had a Rose wine flight and a cookie butter latte. Everything was extremely tasty and the food that was going by us looked amazing as well. There is not a ton of space, so I'd imagine there could be a wait, especially for brunch or dinner. Parties of more than 6 would probably not be able to be accommodated easily. There is a small kids section on the menu, but since it's a tight space, I'd recommend probably leaving the kiddos at home. Great wine selection as well as some tasty beer bottle selections and few on tap as well. I would definitely recommend this place and plan on coming back soon!"

I ordered the Ham & Swiss with a bowl of the same soup. Everything was so delicious! My ham sandwich had a spicy mustard made in house by the owner, Rich. It has attitude -the mustard not Rich- and I loved it. Unfortunately I didn't take pictures of the food. Rich pulled up a chair and chatted with us a bit-so friendly. We'll definitely go back!"

Someone apparently forgot to make the tater tots we ordered and I asked that they cancel it, but they brought it anyway. The server forgot to bring water that was asked for. It's a shame because the food was actually quite tasty, but I don't really want to come back due to the service."

I did have the bourbon pecan latte and it rocked. Would highly recommend reservations after being there. It is small and justifiably very busy"

Shared that with the owner who greeted us  us the first time .\nSaturday we had reservations for four at 6:30 the patio. The owner recognized us, I confirmed that that we enjoyed it so much I brought our friends. Sadly,  our experience was NOT GOOD this time. Initially when we got there they were not very busy but it still took us 23 minutes to get a drink. I went to the owner at 21 minutes and ask if we could get our drink order or at least water ?   He replied with an answer about how they were probably taking care of other people... clearly that was the case. He  had two servers for  too many people. The young lady was  knowledgeable and  efficient  but overwhelmed .The young man was clearly not as well informed about the menu and definitely a new waiter , asked us repeatedly about our order . drink glasses dry more than once,  dirty dishes left on the table until  I finally asked for them to be removed.\nBottom line is we were not taken  care of.  I feel like the owner had an opportunity to save it for us acknowledging the delay and instead after finally getting our drinks the rest of the meal service flowed the same way. Our dining experience ,although still wonderful because of our friends, was not enhanced by my restaurant choice this time. My husband and I love to eat, and  we both worked in food service in college he an excellent waiter/ lime cook and myself a bartender and waitress. So we appreciate good service. He says we're not going back, I might give them more chance because the food is good and they are very conveniently located for us."

            "review_text": "Been wanting to try Grounds and Vine since they opened, but life just got in the way. My husband made \"surprise\" reservations to celebrate my birthday. When I learned we were having dinner here, I was really looking forward to it.\nWhen we walked in, my husband said we had reservations, and we were immediately seated at a quaint little table for two on the patio. We were immediately presented with plastic cups filled with water, and straws.\nThe owner introduced himself (didn't mention his name, but said he was the owner) and we told him how excited we were to have dinner at a local Kannapolis NC restaurant owned by someone from the Midwest, which is where we are from, too.\nThe owner talked about the sauces and what he is planning to do in the near future of the food here, and we are PUMPED to see this evolution, especially since we like spicy most times, but it's very nice to have milder options. When we started asking questions about the wines, the owner sent his wife out to deal with our inquiries. Tell you what! - If you like trying wines from everywhere- and I mean Everywhere! - this place is for you! Bring your reading glasses so you can study the wine list. If you're looking for something specific, it's HERE! His wife didn't share her name either, but she was so Sweet!!!! And very educated about the wine. She found the PERFECT wine for my husband (ended up being from the largest family owned vineyard in NC), and found one for me (from Portugal) that I liked so much I bought a bottle to take home!\nIn the midst of figuring out the right wine, we ordered the loaded tater tots. These were HEAVENLY! - Totally hit the spot! Unfortunately, once we got through the Tater tots and the (very generous) wine samples, we sat twiddling our thumbs for about 20 minutes before someone came to take our \"actual\" drink and dinner order. No big deal today as we were not in a hurry like usual. We decided to try the Octoberfest German wine flight (so\nwe could decide what might be other options to pair best with our dinner as well as an enjoyable wine to savor after dinner), which was a great sampling of German wines to fit almost every pallet. We also ordered from the \"Chef's Specials\" dinner menu.\nOur flights came about 7 minutes later from when we ordered, followed by our dinner about another 8 minutes later. Our plates looked stellar! - Beautiful Plating!\nWe were half way through dinner before we had a chance to order our wine we thought would pair the best.\nOur bill, with the tip pre-populated on the screen came to just under $130.00. - Not too bad for great hospitality and atmosphere, as well as a bottle of good wine to savor later.\nWe plan to go back; maybe for lunch as the sandwiches we saw looked Incredibly delicious. We're also looking forward to the new, hand-crafted sauces. The owner and his wife are wonderful people! A definite \"must try it out for yourself\"! (The coffee menu looks amazing as well, but specialty coffees are not my thing. I drink green tea.)\nCheck it out!"

            "review_text": "First time trying here. Took my wife for her birthday. Had heard nothing but great things about the food. Owner from Ohio. We're originally from Wisconsin. Thought Midwestern food, how could we go wrong. The good! Very hospitable. Greeted by owner at our table. He sent his wife out because he is the food guy and she is the wine expert. Many to choose from. She did very good and was very personable. I had the best blackberry wine I have ever had. The loaded tater tots. Best I have had in many years. Definitely a must try if you dine here. Atmosphere was great. Beautiful patio and nice little dining area. Being from Wisconsin, bonus they had the Brewers game on. We opted for the patio. Actually a nice little view over looking the side road off hwy 73. Now on to the bad. I chose the \"no pasta lasagna\" and my wife had the \"baked salmon\". The lasagna had a layer of burned cheese covered by a layer of freshly baked mozzarella. The mozzarella was great. However,  the rest had the burnt flavor all the way through. The sauce wasn't the worst I've had, but definitely could have used something to sweeten up. Had the bitter taste of tomato paste. The garlic bread was actually really good. Great crisp, but yet soft center which is difficult to do for homemade. Overall, I would give that meal a 2 out of 5. My wife's salmon meal a different story. We'll start with the bland rice. Just plain white rice with nothing added. The asparagus was like it never cooked. My wife never leaves asparagus, but she ate 4 bites and said no. The baked salmon was so baked,it looked like it was overseared in a fry pan and was so dry it had to actually be cut to eat it. The roumalade sauce to my wife tasted like Dijon mustard. When the owner asked how our food was, my wife told him the salmon was way overcooked and the sauce had way too much Dijon mustard. His reply was it doesn't have any mustard and he walked away. Did not like the criticism at all. I do understand. I want to think everything coming out of my kitchen is top notch,but when it's not, I also want to take the time to learn why and improve on the mistakes. I was disappointed in the fact that he knew it was our first time there, my wife's birthday,and he didn't even show an ounce of care about her having a satisfying meal. Very disappointed actually. Also, we did end up sitting for about 20 minutes between finishing our appetizer and $25 wine flight before our waitress reappeared and asked if we were ready to order a drink and our dinner. Overall, not the worst place we've been, and we will definitely go back. We also give a 3 strike system and from what we have heard, the sandwiches here are to die for. Not a great experience this time for us. But if you are going to take your spouse out for a nice birthday evening, I would think it through as to where you choose. Overall not a bad deal for an appetizer, 2 bad main courses, a wine flight and 2 glasses of wine. Just under $130 with a 19% tip included."

I got the ham and sourdough, MAYBE a smidge of cheese, and that was it. See attached photo. Didn't receive chips, no mustard, tomatoes, or greens. $12 is a LOT for two slices of ham on some bread.

The diverse menu offered numerous options, and the drink menu, especially for wine lovers, was exceptional. We savored lobster Mac and cheese, meatball sliders, and a grilled cheese with bisque soup--flavors that were truly unparalleled. A bottle of mimosa added a delightful touch, and even the coffee, which I usually don't enjoy, won me over with its special blend. The owners' attentiveness and the staff's patience and friendliness made our visit memorable.\n\nThey have a lovely patio so the summer will be relaxing to have lunch dates on. I will say pricing was pretty good I think it can suit everyone's budget. They did a great job. We learned they have only been open for two years. Highly recommend this gem and looking forward to returning soon!"

Tighter seating inside but a nice sized patio as well, which even had heating lamps. We were greeted and seated by the owner as soon as we entered the building, he was very friendly. They had a nice selection of coffees and a big selection of wines to choose from. I was pleasantly surprised by the big selection of food options as well. Which we ordered a flatbread and a piece of cake, both were absolutely amazing! Wish we lived in the area to try other foods on the menu. The only thing was when we first ordered a bottle of wine, the server never told us they were out of that bottle until after we had all the food at the table, which typically you'd get the wine before the food. Then after we ordered a second option, it took 2 serves to locate that bottle, which still took close to 10 mins to get after the food. Other than that, which maybe just needs some organization, the place and food were amazing. We'll definitely go back when we're in the area again!"

We went for breakfast and the atmosphere as soon as you walk in is great, the bar looks cute, and I want to come back and sit on the patio. We went for breakfast and I got the Avocado Toast, menu reads \"Sourdough toast, fresh avocado, arugula and balsamic glaze\" sounds super yummy so I ordered it. What the menu fails to mention is the crushed tomato spread that's on top of the avocado and covers the entire toast. Now I personally do not like tomatoes, so I would have definitely ordered it with no tomatoes had I known it was on there. This pretty much ruined the breakfast for me. The people were very friendly, but we asked for waters as soon as we sat down and never got them. I'm still planning on giving it another go though, and I'll ask if anything has tomatoes."

It's the best chicken salad I have had, not even close at all. My girlfriend had mexican corn flatbread, which also was delicious. It was hard for me not to eat half of hers after I finished my sandwich. The chef brought out a no-pasta lasagna for us to try, which we finished after we were full from dinner because it was just that good. We tried a few of their sauces as well and had to take 2 of them home. We took home 1 lb. of the chicken salad as well, and I finished half of it as soon as we got back to Raleigh. I wish I could give this place 10 stars, now I just need to find out if they can ship more chicken salad to me! Do not pass this place up, it is phenomenal."

Ugh. Then was told by a lady manager that the roasted peppers would \"compromise the integrity of the sandwich\". So, I didn't get the sandwich the way I wanted & didn't enjoy it. Just a super buttery grilled turkey & cheese. Also ordered tomato bisque soup of the day instead of chips & I got chips.\n\nOn a positive note, it's a cute place with a coffee of the day and outdoor seating."

I did not feel welcomed at all!! I felt overlooked and like they didn't want my business. I couldn't tell you why.... I was just standing there quietly waiting to order my coffee and lemonade.\nANYWAY, when I saw her walk around the counter to take the others order instead of mine... I left!

The options were more like (expensive) diner food; not options you would expect at a place that serves nice bottles of wine. The salad dressing came in a plastic package...very diner-esque. Not professional at all.\n\nWe were hoping for a new go-to place based on other reviews and word-of-mouth, but the food quality wasn't wonderful. Also hardly any options for vegetarians.  It's a bit strange to serve coffee drinks in to-go cups for those who are dining in. The frappuccino was more of a chocolate slushy, but my husband said the coffee is better than Starbucks (if that's saying much)."

We make our espresso at home and called in advance to inquire as to whether they had fresh whole beans for sale and they said they did. When we arrived to the store, we noticed there were customers sitting outside and inside and the OPEN sign on the door was aglow. We went to go inside and the door was locked. The people inside sitting at the bar just stared at me and didn't open the door. I decided I wasn't welcome there and began to leave when another couple behind us tried the door again, locked. Except this time they were immediately let in by the workers. The couple held the door open for us and we decided to come in. Upon entering the building, we were given extremely dirty looks by two customers sitting at the bar and one employee sitting at the bar having her lunch. There were a couple other workers behind the bar, none of which greeted us (nor did the one sitting at the bar). We asked for a pound of coffee and while we waited for the barista to prepare it, we were continuously given an unwelcome glare from both the employee at the bar and the 2 customers. I basically picked up the vibe that this place was for \"members-only\" or something. I felt extremely unwelcome. Also, the beans we paid $17 (for ONE POUND) for were not fresh...which is extremely disappointing when I could have gone to Lowe's foods on a Friday and gotten a pound of wonderfully fresh beans for $5.\n\nI'm really not sure what my husband and I (and our toddler) did to be treated so strangely. I'm super disappointed because this place seemed really cool and the food looked good, but it's not worth it for us. I've never felt so uncomfortable at a coffee shop in my life."
