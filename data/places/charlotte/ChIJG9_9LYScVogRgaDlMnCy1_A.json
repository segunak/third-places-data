They have a discord to help organize gaming communities for each of the product lines they support which was helpful finding players for Saturday night. Their commander nights are Monday and Friday and it seems like they fire multiple pods and all the players and the staff were super friendly and helpful. They have additional tables in the back that are large enough to support D&D and multiple table top games and they carry a huge stock of boardgames, D&D books, minis, dice, paints, Warhammer 40k, and even have drinks including draft and canned beer.\n\nThis is a great spot for gaming in Charlotte and was one of the highlights of the weekend!"

They provide both standing and sitting tables that allow for patrons to coordinate and play tabletop games. They allow food and beverages to be brought in to consume. They also offer a few alcoholic beverages on tap, along with non-alcoholic beverages from a cooler behind the counter.\n\nThe prices are fair and it is a good, local business that you should be proud to supoort. They offer a discord channel to help people connect with other gamers to game with. The staff is always friendly, kind, and willing to share any information they have about any of the games they have or know about. They help you connect with artists in the community or businesses you might be looking for. If you have a specific game purchase request, they will order it for you if they have access to it and they provide updates to you by phone calls to let you know the progress.\n\nMy one truly critical observation is that there is an extremely pungent and sharp odor similar to a men's locker room that is difficult to ignore. The odor hits you immediately upon opening the doors and it is very powerful. If you are sensitive to strong odors, this may be something to consider. This can be controlled by shampooing the carpets regularly or even removing the carpets that trap most of that odor and simply allowing the concrete to be on the floor."

Most of the new board games were in stock, and a really nice selection of older games as well.\n\nThere's a good amount of room for in-store gaming (around 8-10 good gaming tables if I'm remembering correctly). They have snacks and drinks available for when you get hungry during a long session. And there's also a wall of demo games so you can get a feel for the games you're interested in before you buy them.\n\nHighly recommended."

What sets this place apart from others is the friendly atmosphere and the fact that they serve beer, ciders and other malt liquors. They host events all the time and it's always a good time when I go."
