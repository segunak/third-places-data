This was definitely a hit though! I love that my latte has a nice sweet flavor while also being able to taste the espresso. I think they do a fantastic job balancing the sweetener to coffee ratio. I ordered a caramel marshmallow iced latte and loved it.\n\nMy boyfriend stopped in to grab us coffee again today and I got the same drink, and it tasted the same as when I got it the other day so they're definitely consistent. We also tried the donut holes last time we visited, and those were great too.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and chatty with customers which is always nice to see anywhere you go. We will definitely come again in the future and make this our new go to spot."

I love creative mixes for my lattes, but it always falls very flat here. At Starbucks, they lack variety especially in sugar-free, but when they put syrup in you can taste it. You can taste it too much and as a matter of fact at Starbucks I always tell them to do half of the amount of syrup they normally do, so I'm not a person that likes an over sugary and syrupy drink. I'm writing this review because at this location, even though they have such cool interesting sounding drinks, you can't taste the syrup at all. It tastes like drinking espresso with warmed milk and a little tiny bit of sweetener, but no flavor whatsoever. I guess if I return to try their coffee, I'm going to have to ask for additional pumps and then watch it be too sweet would be my luck. Again, I'm really happy with all the flavor combinations offered here but you can't taste it."

I've gone to Biggby for years back home (was so excited when they opened here!!) and have been in love with their sweet foam cold brew which is the best ever made, hands down! What makes the experience the best is the people here. John and Melissa are amazing and go above and beyond to make sure everyone is happy and enjoying their coffee (even when I can be a pain!) and you build a relationship with the rest of the staff when you go every day. They treat you like family and you know each other on a first name basis, which you don't get very often in the world. Everyone I bring coffee to at my work absolutely loves their coffee and they all look forward to $5 Friday! I would give them 100 stars if I could but I'm limited to 5 so I will end with this... I love Biggby coffee no matter where I go but what makes this one special and the absolute best is the owners and the people who are making our coffee everyday. I appreciate y'all and thank y'all for everything!"

A chewy basic grocery store bagel that had not one bit of toastiness to it and NO cream cheese. Didnt figure this out until I was down the road or i would have asked for a refund.\nUnclear what their business model is but someone needs to revisit it."

To add to that, there was barely ANY cream cheese so I essentially just got a bagel with no topping.  I chalked it up to a one time thing and returned a couple days later. Today, I got an everything bagel with bacon egg and cheese. I struggled to get a bite out of it it was so hard. Oddly enough, the bottom was salvageable and I was able to eat that but the top was so hard it made my teeth hurt. I'm not sure if the bagels were stale or what but I've never had an experience like that with a bagel. Too many inconsistencies."

The location is still relatively new so everything was super clean and in great condition. We went inside to order and there are plenty of seats and tables. There is a drive-thru but we didn't use it. Biggby Coffee is a refreshing and delightful change from other coffee shops. I'll stop by again in the future."

This location just opened today with the most friendly franchisees I've ever met and they've hired an amazingly friendly staff. I look forward to many a caffeinated beverage and bragel!\n\nThe environment inside has some comfortable seating, but I wouldn't say it has the same atmosphere as a Starbucks or local coffee shop where you would go to study or work. It's somewhere in between a DD and a Starbucks. Delicious food and coffee is their strong point."
