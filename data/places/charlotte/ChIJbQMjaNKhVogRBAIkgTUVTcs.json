I came here tonight thinking that I would be treated with respect and courtesy like I am with my company HOWEVER THAT IS NOT THE CASE. A bartender decided to become belligerent and rude with a friend of mine. We had a hard time the whole time getting his attention and when I finally got it he was incredibly rude to my friend. I was not accepting of this treatment. And demanded an apology and the bartender refused and the subsequently didn't serve my friend. I have the right of mind to stay until closing and talk to him about his behavior. People need to think before acting."

We got the 3 meat plate and some chicken wings. Brisket, pulled pork, and chicken quarter were all good. Chicken wings had good flavor but we're a bit soggy to be \"extra crispy\". Fried corn and onion rings were both great.\n\nThe place is awesome. Red lights and decorations all over. It's very spacious too with beer pong games that you can play.\n\nI have to say I was disappointed with the service. When we arrived we stood at the door aimlessly because despite them having a hostess table and menus there was no one to great us at the front and no sign to seat ourselves. After that no words were said to us. We got our food and drinks through a QR code we scanned. When we recieved them there relatively no interactions. No one checked up on how the food was. There was atleast 4 people working the floor too but they stood in the corner talking on their phones. I was very disappointed in all of this.\n\nOverall, the food was standard, enviorment was fun, service was well below average."

A few months back, Resident Culture swapped their taco trailer for American BBQ, led by Brazilian pitmaster Edmar Simoes, making it my destination of choice today. I arrived at around 12:30 pm on a Sunday, the crowd still sparse, likely indulging in brunch before their South End drinking escapades. Settling at the spacious bar, bartender Angel offered sincere advice on the menu, recommending garlic butter chicken wings or the smoked chicken egg roll. Yet, my heart was set on brisket, my go-to gauge for BBQ joints, leading me to order the smoked brisket sandwich ($14) with a couple of pickle slices, onion and a choice of white or red slaw.\n\nThe sandwich was promptly served, the sliced smoked brisket meat was lukewarm, nestled in a brioche bun accompanied by sliced onions and pickles. Unfortunately, it fell short of expectations--lacking in fat, the meat was dry, and without any BBQ sauce provided. Angel informed me that the choice fattier cuts weren't available. Among the three BBQ sauce options--eastern Carolina vinegar, house BBQ, or Carolina mustard--I found the house BBQ sauce essential to moisten the dry brisket. While the smoked brisket had a pleasant taste, the brioche bun was unremarkable, and the side of white slaw, although satisfactory, was modestly portioned in a two-ounce souffle cup\n\nWhile the meal itself was underwhelming, the interaction with Angel and his welcoming demeanor was a silver lining. If a return visit occurs, I may venture into the pulled chicken or pork, optimistic for a more fulfilling experience."

This is connected to Resident Culture, which I did not try, but I had no desire to come back. Perk? If it's your first time there, they give you a card for a free drink the next time you visit. Their tables are in large stalls, so if you need privacy, this is a good choice."

We had to order our food through the app that is located at the table.

If you work remotely you know it can be hard to find a place where you feel like you aren't stealing space from other customers. This place has plenty of space, outlets, the staff has always been incredibly nice, you can order from your table (nice so you don't have to leave your crap unattended), and they actually encouraged me to work from there. Internet is a little slow but nothing using a phone hotspot can't fix it you need to do video calls. Every time I go here they treat me like we're friends. 100/10 recommend"

Vibes are great, awesome music (different DJ's with a variety of genres) even live music sometimes. Hard working Bartenders and tight security. I typically go out solo but the security at RC helps me to feel safe while I'm there.  I go for about 3hrs to dance for my cardio.

We were in town for a concert and of course, when in rome, drink beer. We made our way down to Resident Culture a little early, about 30 minutes before the bar actually opened but when we walked through the door we were immediately greeted with genuine hospitality and offered to go ahead and get a beer early. Don't have to tell us twice. As usual, we went with the stout and a hazy IPA and we then had the argument that this was the best stout I've had since Norse Brewing came out with Phat Thor. Incredible atmosphere in this place. We finished our beer and on the way out we couldn't skip the coffee bar that in the back (NEXT TO TACOS). The coffee was just as good. If we're in the area again, we'll for sure be back."

Great coffee and tacos to enjoy before it's time to have a beer.\n\nI ordered a latte and a chorizo taco. It's pretty popular here, so the wait was longer than I had expected, but once they arrived, it was top notch all the way around. The latte was smooth with a slightly bitter kick, just the way I like. The taco was a good size for the price, and the chorizo, while a bit greasy, was popping with flavor and blended well with the egg and cheese, and the tortilla was quite enjoyable as well.\n\nDefinitely a good place to stop for coffee in south end!"

Being a regular at reputable places around Charlotte, I expected a higher level of personalized customer service than what RC had to offer. The door staff treats patrons as if they are TSA and will find any reason to deny entry. While my friends and I made it in without issues, many other prospective patrons did not. Once inside, you enter the land of try hards and ballers on a budget. Cocktails are about as good as one could make themselves and their liquor selection was nonexistent. The only reason this place got 2 instead of 1 star is because the bartender was very friendly. Don't come here. Don't waste your money. South end has so much more to offer and RC is definitely the bottom tier."

We also had to reschedule last minute due to Covid, and she helped us reschedule with ease.\n2. The new space is also BEAUTIFUL and lively and fun. We booked the private room, which was spacious and had a ton of natural light. They had a really cool drink ordering system that brought us drinks so we didn't have to wait in line at the bar.\n3. Drinks and food were great. This isn't shocking coming from Resident Culture.\n4. There's a beautiful event space coming downstairs for any brides looking to get married in South End!\n\nLooking forward to making this a regular spot. We will definitely look to book another event there soon. Thank you Emily and Resident Culture!"

You have to be 21+ to get in (at night) . There's enough room for everyone. They have tables on the main floor , at the back of the main floor and outdoor sitting too. Going to the restroom, they have a Disco ball spinning that's pretty cool. The DJ is on point with the music selection . Menu of their drinks on the TV. I'll say it like a mini optimist Hall but without the multiple food outlets. Overall, great experience. It's a spot to chill let loose with great friends."

They were a little behind at the grand opening but it was expected. A lot of people have been waiting for the opening so its understandable that the line was long. I was hyped to go and I wasn't disappointed. The scan to pay for your order is a great idea because when you are finished, you close your tab and leave. Overall, 10/10"

            "review_text": "I went to the grand opening, and will give this place a grain of salt. There was a line out the door, about a 30 minute wait. When we were able to go in, it was quite busy inside with not enough seating. However the decorations are quite modern and colorful.\n\nThe taco place was hard to find as there isn't obvious signage and there is no physical place to order. You have to order through their website/QR code. They text you when your order is ready, but it wasn't obvious, so I thought I might have missed my order. It took about 40 minutes to receive my food after ordering. The tacos are really really good though. They're about $3.50 each and are just solid street tacos.\n\nThe wait for the beer wasn't too bad, but I did see long lines later in the night. There's one main bar and a smaller bar towards the back. I ordered a Mexican lager and it was pretty good standard beer.\n\nWe luckily found a table, but I experienced sensory overload. There was a lot of people, but the acoustics of the place amplified the sound. The colorful decorations could also be much after a while. I recommend going when it is not busy if you are sensitive to loud sounds and colors/lights. The wait staff was attentive and the place itself was clean.\n\nOverall, a nice addition to the breweries in South end!"
