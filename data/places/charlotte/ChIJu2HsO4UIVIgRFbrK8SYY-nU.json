I said well online said you are open now from 7:00 to 12:00 it did not say anything about opening drive-thru at 7:00 and store at 9:00 and she's gave me a look like she didn't care and kind of brushed me off.

Plenty of books, places to sit and enjoy some coffee & socializing with friends and family, maybe even meet for a book club.\nShe gave me a short tour of the bookstore and coffee shop (I found out their beans are roasted in Greensboro, NC). The baked goods are made by Honeybear bake shop in Charlotte. They have a few gluten-free options.\n\nIf you love books and coffee ! supporting local, this is for you er's\n\nJosephine Local Guide  (JLG)"

If they don't have what book you're looking for, they'll order it. Couldn't ask for a better spot *and* there's a drive-thru plus a rewards system. Love love love.\n\nP.S. If you're new and looking for the entrance, there's an exit-only lane directly next to the building. The actual turn in entrance is just past the intersection light with a small sign, and you drive around back until you get to Editions on the end (there's an entrance from the parking lot back there)."

They also have earrings handmade by a local business, some special edition books, stickers, tote bags, Magic/D&D merchandise, and baked goods/candy. My roommate and I always enjoy coming here to work on our creative projects or just relax for a while. Workers have always been friendly :)\n\nHUGE bonus that they have a drive-thru--if you don't have time to stop and chill, I definitely still recommend grabbing a drink. Only cons are limited hours and a weird parking lot entrance (it's a good bit before/after the Editions building depending on the direction from which you're coming).\n\nOverall my favorite coffee/book shop in the Concord and Kannapolis area!"

If was a frozen key lime flavored treat!  I perused the bookstore while I waited (not a long wait at all) and found a true crime novel by my favorite author John Douglas. Jenn and Scott were great book conversationalist as they were extremely knowledgeable and recognized John Douglas and his work (not many do). Again, highly recommend this cozy friendly place for great drinks and books!"

            "review_text": "Coffee is good, no issues with that. The low rating, however, is due to inconsistency in the sizes of their drinks. I've gone consistently to this coffee shop over the course of the last year, and at first there were no issues. But as of the last 3 maybe 4 trips, we've begun to pick up on the sizing of the drinks we're receiving as totally different than previous times. The same drink is ordered each visit, and it's always a large  macchiato & a small coffee of some variance. The first visits, the large was consistent with what anyone would consider a large coffee from a smaller shop, but now the large is DRASTICALLY smaller, I'd say in comparison, it's roughly in between a Starbucks Tall & Grande. The small cup has stayed the same throughout each trip, so that doesn't seem to have changed. At this point, we've unfortunately chalked it up to the young people working the drive thru window, expecting to be tipped & when they are familiar with a vehicle that doesn't routinely tip, they decide they'll take it upon themselves to charge us for a large, but serve us with a reg. (Medium) size or smaller. The tip culture in this world has gotten completely absurd, if we felt as if you as a barista DESERVED a tip, you would have gotten one... but things like this are the main reason we don't believe everyone deserves a tip. Say we had tipped, we'd be left leaving the shop with an unpleased transaction of receiving half the coffee we paid for. We love supporting small businesses, which is why we've chose to come back time & time again, to only be served with a repeat of the same issue. $13 spent on two small coffees is a bit unreasonable considering there are copious amounts of alternative coffee spots in the area that will match their pricing with their sizing. All in all, your baristas should have received their much needed tips in the midst of their eager overcharging, & UNDER providing of the correct amount of coffee purchased."

            "review_text": "Worst family to own a coffee shop! Greedy and humiliating. I am an extremely positive person. The boy that has parents that own the shop is the rudest child I have met in a coffee house, coffee is a time for peace and chat. Not a time to listen to the child of the owners laugh at you and talk about you. Mind you this child must be over 20 , sad , sad coffee house if you want to call it that....\nThere is a wonderful and happy coffee house right around the corner if you like to be treated as a human. FRENCH EXPRESS !Their coffees are consistent and truly delicious! Not to mention the staff really cares about its customers. They laugh with you not at you. Thank you FRENCH EXPRESS , Editions cannot begin to touch the awesomeness FRENCH EXPRESS COFFEE carries in the air , in the coffees , bakery items , smoothies and more....\nI give no stars to Editions Coffee. Too bad they are in our precious town here in Kannapolis!\nOnce again I am thankful FRENCH EXPRESS is right around the corner from EDITIONS .FrenchExpress is great to lounge, read, chat, one can even bring their DOGGIES INSIDEat FRENCH EXPRESS . Equipped with a drive thru window. Do not waste your time , your kindness or money at EDITIONS!\nSide note- I stopped through EDITIONS the other day to see if possibly they would be nice and my gals and I can meet there again.\nUnfortunately, they absolutely did not like the fact I arrived 16 minutes before the store was to close at 2 pm. So I ordered my coffee and was sternly told \" no, we cannot serve anything but regular brew!!\" So I was looking at the menu, trying to figure out a different drink. I drink decaf. I asked if she could make my drink with regular brewed coffee as she said was my only choice.\nI asked for decaf , which is what I drink if the store cannot serve it , est la vive.\nI was ready for my treat so I figured that she d figure out a great solution. Still positive,Well, her next comment \" we cannot do decaf.\" My eyes gazed back at the menu. She started to mumble \" well maybe I could make it for you but you do understand that we are closing and I have already broken down the machines. So! I ll just have to reclean !?\"She stared at me w waiting for an answer and I said \" great! Thank you so much!!\nShe was not happy to say the least.\nJust a report.\nI ll stop by again in some months."

Coffee also in wide varieties, cold, hot, fancy, plain, strong, sweet etc. Over all just a nice place to kill some time, enjoy a beverage, and maybe find a new favorite book to crack open.\n\nUpdate: YOU CAN TRADE IN USED BOOKS ON TUESDAYS! See the owner for details but this makes a huge difference! Part of what stops me from buying books is not enough shelf space, but if I can trade in ones that weren't good enough to keep...GAME CHANGER. Also coffee is still really good, my wife may be an addict...\n\nThey have done some rearranging, but still a huge variety. Slightly smaller non-fiction section but we still keeps finding gems we hadnt expected. Also try the trivia events! There are so many different ones!"

They will take trade-ins for store credit, and they also sell new books, and some cool merchandise! They are definitely worth visiting....next time I plan to go when I have more time to explore! OH...and the coffee is AMAZING!! The only less positive thing I can say is that I was not comfortable looking for books on the shelves in the seating/restaurant area....there were lots of people at the tables, and it felt intrusive to try to stand virtually right beside strangers enjoying their coffee and scour over a book shelf. Other than that, just great!"

I've loved it over the years and was so excited when they remodeled and added a drive through--more to love!\n\nTheir iced Nitro Coffee Nudge with sweet cream is my absolute favorite. Bring your dog--mine absolutely loves getting her \"puppuccino\"!!!\n\nIf you're into books then you'll definitely find something to read here. I've brought in some of my well kept books and had them exchanged for credits so I can get more books--what a concept. :)\n\nEditions is an awesome local business. I am so happy it's here in Kannapolis!"
