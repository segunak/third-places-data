Both of the ladies there smiled the entire time, taking orders and making coffee. It seemed like they actually loved their jobs and these days that's rare. So 5 for the customer service. It was a cute shop but I honestly was in and out after my coffee was done. I'm sure if you had time to lounge there it would be nice. I also loved the art in bathroom (random I know) but those tiny details make huge differences. Okay now to the coffee. I ordered a Large Lavender Latte with 2 extra shots of espresso & oat milk. I also grabbed the granola to eat in the car for my long drive home. That coffee was so dang good I didn't even get a photo. It had the perfect amount of lavender & foam. I mean it was silky and so easy to drink. Had they not been closed on my way home I would've returned to get a second cup. The granola was yummy too, a bit messy in the car but I had enough when I got home the next morning I used it on my yogurt and it was delicious. Wondering can I order and have it shipped? Any ways this little gem is a must try!!!!"

Needed a spot to study so I hunkered down in the corner with a cup of drip coffee, and later a chocolate scone (rec from Darian? I'm terrible with names!) Delicious scone! I recommend as well  I could tell that the team behind the counter love what they do because there was such a positive vibe with each customer interaction. Service is impeccable. It's an intimate spot for studying, conversation, card-playing, or simply relaxing during the day.\nLocal artist work adorn the walls...LOVE that!! I will definitely be back  Thanks for a great experience!"

There are coloring pages and crayons, board books as well as some paperback novels and board games. There's also a stepstool in the bathroom for reaching the sink.\n\nI got the strawberries and cream coffee (seasonal drink) and it was so good! I think when I visited before, I had a lavender latte and that was yummy. They also will substitute oat or almond milk without an upcharge.\n\nIt's located in a new shopping center on The Plaza, with a few other businesses in the same building. They have a nice outdoor patio."

Summit on the Plaza is no exception!\n\nI love this location because there is ample parking, it's easy to access on my way to and fro, and there's plenty of seating both inside and on the patio. The baristas are super kind and knowledgeable, and their pastry case stays stocked with delicious pastries. They also have a fridge with a few non coffee options (seltzer waters, local craft beers, etc.) if you're not in the mood for coffee. Maybe my favorite thing is that they don't upcharge alternative milks.\n\nThey do also have an app available that is very functional and allows mobile ordering as well as a rewards program - great for busy mornings."
