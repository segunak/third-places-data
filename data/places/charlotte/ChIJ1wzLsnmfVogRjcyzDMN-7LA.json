No spread, no seasoning, no cheese, no greens, no other toppings of any kind. Disappointing food experience for sure.

We ordered two sandwiches and a coffee (Sat 12/9, 1pm), and while the coffee was provided quickly, we waited over 20 mins for the sandwiches and every other person in the store was waiting as well. Only after I went to the cashier to ask for a status after providing very little response without a smile did she go back and about 3-4 orders were brought out between herself and 2-3 back kitchen staff. When the food arrived, it was tasty, though the bread was overly toasted/hard. Unfortunately we've had a similar experience at the Ballantyne location, and while I like the Midtown one, I can no longer go to Sunflower with my wife. We've been burned with a bad experience one too many times. Please coach staff to be more engaged, turn around food in a timely manner, and really focus on the customer experience. This is what hurt our visit more than anything."

And, as I presume - the owner/manager license plate \"SOURDOH!\", was parked, without a handicap sticker or plate taking up both handicap slots behind the establishment! If that doesn't send a message about their attitude and customer service regarding handicapped individuals, I don't know what else will?

There was only 3 other customers sitting in the bakery having coffee. Now I will say I did not tip (it was togo and an overpriced sandwich plus it was drip coffee and she handed me a bag of chips). The 1 star is for the sandwich. I ordered the turkey, brie, and cranberry \"spread\" sandwich. It came out with a glob of spread in the center of sandwich, 1 slice of turkey and the brie only in the center of the sandwich. It was just awful! I can only assume it was because I did not tip. I need to remind myself to never order sandwiches and stick to coffee and bakery items."

Of course I said no and asked for my food to be remade. I waited 15 minutes, hoping that when my order finally came out it would be accompanied with a remedy. No such balm came so I had to ask for a refund. The manager kindly issued a refund without hesitation, thankfully. This is my second time eating sunflower and the magic of the first experience was lost this time around. The food just isn't as good as I remember, but it's still one of the best biscuits I've had in the city. I would order again...ps: the menu says roasted tomatoes but my biscuit came with one lone tomato slice and I'm pretty sure I'm missing my pesto sauce...lol I just wish things went smoother."

After being reassured multiple times by the cashier that our sandwiches were being made, we left with a refund because he had never given the slip to the back and they ran out of bread!! Not sure how they expected to remian open for 4 more hours with absolutely no product. Staff was flippant, unapologetic and annoyed when we were upset we never got our food. Multiple other customers left after being told their food was being made when the slips were never brought to the back. A waste of an hour waiting for sandwiches they never intended to make. Won't be returning any time soon."

An example of this is not asking to warm up pastries.\n\nExpediting: There was one staff member literally standing around waiting for someone to just make an order while others stood in line. You could minimize waiting times by expediting orders and shifting priorities based on who needs support. This is common sense folks...\n\nOverall experience:\nThe outside seating is a nice touch. But the flimsy wood chairs and tables take away from the experience."

Service at the Dilworth location is consistently slow and the young staff they have in the front of house give off an apathetic vibe. This has clearly been reflected in the quality and timeliness of every experience I've had there. On one a occasion, we placed a pickup order which took an additional 40 minutes to receive past the initial 25 minute wait time we were given on the website. Over an hour for 2 breakfast sandwiches?! Every time we'd go to the counter to check on the status of the order we were told just a couple more minutes - meanwhile our coffees were ready but NOT given to us, only to get cold while they sat on the counter for nearly an hour. Another time I came shortly after opening when there was no wait but it still took nearly 30 minutes for a single breakfast sandwich to come out correctly (an incorrect order was given to me after about 12-15 minutes) and when I got home with it the bread seemed stale and inedible. I don't mind waiting for a quality, made-to-order product, but all of our orders here have left something to be desired and certainly have not been worth the painful wait times and meh service."

That was 2 weeks ago with no response by anyone at Sunflower. Now I'm going through my credit card company to dispute the charge since Sunflower haven't taken up the responsibility in getting me my refund.

If you order vanilla syrup in your drink, expect to taste none of it, because I'm pretty sure they either forget or put like one drop and that's it (even though it costs extra). They also give me the wrong size half the time. If you order any modifications on your food, it's doubtful they will accommodate those modifications. It's just disappointing because I used to come here all the time but I have to ask for like an extra cup full of vanilla syrup because you can't taste it. I think the workers just need more training on how to properly prepare coffee drinks"

Both times I have ordered items in the bakery counter that are listed on the online menu they were not available. I received a call the first time to cancel or sub out the item but they just automatically cancelled it today. (I have 3 kids and coming home with 2 items doesn't make for family peace!)  Also, the online order does not always translate to the item you pick up - I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and received a pimento cheese instead. (I thought I may have messed it up but double checked the online receipt and it was correct.) I was already home when realizing it and my daughter was thankfully flexible on eating a different sandwich than ordered."

I ordered the zucchini brownie and a sweet potato/peanut butter cookie that was not described well after asking twice what it was but I love sweet potato and peanut butter so figured it couldn't be bad. My daughter had the croissant and a hot chocolate. The brownie had potential but my scratch made flourless brownies taste better from home. The cookie had things in it that made me not finish (again it was not described well from the beginning), the taste was okay but I do not have to have either again. My daughter is a hot chocolate connoisseur and she disclosed it was not great. BUT the croissant was good...but you can get a good croissant most anywhere.\n\nThe service was even less thrilling than what we ordered. The two girls working weren't rude per se but sometimes great service makes you overlook the places where there is lack. The bites and the hot chocolate were better than the service. Maybe they were having a bad day but I did not feel any hospitality or level of friendliness that I expect from a neighborhood bakery...maybe it's because we don't live in that neighborhood ...I don't know but I don't have to ever return. Glad so many folks love it. I guess it's a matter of taste and \"taste\".  I would like to give them a try for a sandwich and perhaps they can redeem themselves with the flavor part...I will order online to keep my interaction with staff to a minimum to avoid another underwhelming customer service experience.\n\nI have traveled the world and love local spots with good food and good service. Didn't get that here."

The sandwich was amazing, I enjoyed and finished feeling very satisfied. My wife's cheddar biscuit with egg, ham and cheese was great too. Too full to try the cinnamon roll at that very moment. We drove back to Charleston, SC so I waited until we got home to try the cinnamon roll and to my dismay I was disappointed... disappointed that now I have to drive 3 hours to get the awesome cinnamon roll!!!"

            "review_text": "The Bad: We'll cut to the chase here. The East Blvd location is NOT practicing social distancing. I went yesterday (Sunday) morning as a treat for my boyfriend's birthday. It was around 9 AM. Objectively and most likely the busiest time for the bakery, I'll give them that, but when we drove into the parking lot we saw a line almost out of the door and people waiting around inside. I told my boyfriend we could order online instead and just go in briefly to pick up the order, to avoid as much contact as we could. We made the order at 9:28, and the online service said it would be ready at 9:48, so we sat in the car for a while. At 9:50, I headed inside by myself to pick everything up. First, the online order pickup table is to the right of the main counter, which is also the direction that the line snakes around, meaning I would have had to be within 6 feet of at least 5 people just to get my order. I asked the cashier if she could snag it for me, and she went over to grab it. (The front of house staff were great throughout this experience, and this review is not a reflection on them.) I had ordered two breakfast sandwiches, two iced drinks and a croissant. Everything was ready but the breakfast sandwiches; there seemed to be some confusion between two front of house staff members about where the sandwiches were. It took an extra 30 minutes for the sandwiches to be ready.\n\nLook, I get it. It's a busy Sunday morning, and you're wide open. Normally I'm a patient person. But my whole point of ordering online was to avoid standing in your store, where there are no markings on the floor to keep people spaced or a capacity sign on the front door. The line looked like any normal slammed pre-COVID bakery on a Sunday morning. People were not spaced out. And there I was stuck waiting for 30 extra minutes in that environment, constantly trying to move position to have the most amount of people away from me and HIGHLY uncomfortable the whole time. By the time I got the sandwiches my iced drinks were watered down and I was ready to write this review, but I did want to hold off as I hadn't tried the food yet. We got home (5 minute drive) and realized the sandwiches themselves were lukewarm as well. This only further added to irritation-- if the sandwiches had been done for a while, why did I sit in there for 30 minutes? Between the in-the-car waiting period and in the bakery itself, it took almost an hour for my online order to be done. If it was going to take that long, I would have rather waited at home and quickly picked up instead of putting myself in a potentially dangerous exposure situation.\n\nIn short-- guys, this virus is scary. Regardless of your views, it is real and terrifying to some people. It was an abstract concept at the beginning and is becoming more real as people I know post about contracting the virus themselves, and as the Carolinas reach insane peaks. We try to be careful while still supporting local, because we know it's tough and we want you to make it through this, but at least hold up to the option of staying safe if you're going to provide online ordering. I won't be coming back until the worst of COVID-19 is over, and I'm really sad to say that.\n\nThe Good: That being said, the food was delicious. Again, I'm a big Amelie's fan, but Sunflour just does it....better. You won't find as many options as far as actual sweets go, because Sunflour is a bakery first and foremost, but they've got it figured out. The breakfast sandwiches were HUGE. I had a bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant and my boyfriend had the mozz tomato and spinach on a cheese biscuit. I was so jealous of that cheese biscuit, but the croissant was crazy buttery and flakey. The drinks didn't necessarily thrill us, but I suspect it was because they were pretty watery by the time we got to enjoy them. I got a chocolate croissant to go for the next morning's breakfast, and I can't say enough good things about it as well.\n\nI'm sorry, Sunflour. But do better, for the people who love to support you and for Charlotte as a whole."

The almond and chocolate croissants had a teeny bit of filling. It felt like a quarter sized dollop of filling. The croissant itself was pretty good and flaky, but if I'd wanted a plain croissant, that's what I would've gotten. The blueberry cream cheese danish was good though!"
