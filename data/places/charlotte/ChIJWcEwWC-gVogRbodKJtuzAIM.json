            "review_text": "For the past decade, I have ordered Panera catering with confidence.  The menu items are generally  consistent across all restaurant locations.  No surprises. We like to have the valentine cookies catered in for our office staff.  The cookies are usually well decorated which adds to their high quality appearance.  They usually  look exactly like the pictures displayed on the Panera website, however this year's order was a complete failure and such a disappointment. This was a poorly delivered joke. I was embarrassed to serve the cookies.  At $500 for 200 catered cookies, I truly wanted to throw them away.   The appearance of the cookies was unsightly.   The royal icing formula was off and the icing never set.  The icing was very  thick, wet and sticky upon arrival.  The icing smeared everywhere inside the wrapper so much so that it was difficult to try to remove the cookie from the wrapper without getting icing on our hands.  Additionally,  the Panera staff decided to get creative with their own personal designs which was also a complete failure.  The cookies looked as if they had been decorated by young children.  These were no where near professionally decorated cookies.  More than 75% of the cookies were not presentable for a corporate event.  Not sure what happened to Panera's quality control but this will be our last Panera order of any kind .  Attached is a single photo of the assorted valentine cookies pulled from the website,  and the remaining photos are of the cookies we received from the Panera Uptown Charlotte Location on College Street.  This is not what I expect from a professional catering company, especially when the order was placed a few weeks in advance.  ( Update:  We think these  cookies were decorated with cinnamon roll icing. After a full day and night, the icing never did set and is way too thick for royal icing.  The decoration just slides right off the cookie.  It's either cinnamon roll icing or the staff didn't use the correct recipe)"

We had to ask a customer how they ordered and eventually someone came to the front. The staff seem like nice people. But service was very slow. Plus my hot food order was cold and they forgot our pastry. They also didn't put our food on plates, they packaged it to go which made us feel like they wanted us to leave, Even though it was only 1230 and they supposedly close at 2... not the best experience but overall the food was fine ish."

I walked from work on my lunch break to pick up my order. When I arrived, me and another guest were there to pick up and the cashier told us both they closed early because it was slow...knowing they had orders coming in. They cancelled both our orders with not so much as a notification or warning. Yes, I understand Thanksgiving is tomorrow...but it is TOMORROW. Google has their hours until 4:00pm today. If you want to close early, that's fine. But make it known. So not only did I not get my order, but I had to get back to work. Thanks Panera team for your Fabulous Customer Service.\nYou have lost my business!!"

Pretty sure the steak sandwich would have been the same. Poor quality and service. Supply chain is no longer an excuse. Panera and other restaurants are robbing people of their hard earned money. $13.20 + $1.80 tip. = $15 gift card wasted. Mind you, I never eat there on my on dime nor when they cater to the office.

And that salad, for $9+ with tax, is so tiny, in a 4\"x6\" box, it wouldn't supply lunch for a child. When I realized the differential, I asked the manager for a printed menu to see what pricing is listed there, and he replied that there are none.

Even though there is a pump for fake liquid sugar its disgusting and unsanitary and just not the same.  How many hands touch the pump? Today the fake sugar was out at lunch. Last visit there was no toilet paper in the bathroom at lunch. Tables arent wiped down often enough. 1 team member should just be wiping, checking, and stocking all lunch.\nOn the other hand great food always."

First, discovered it had tomatoes on it after walking back to my office, so walked back over to get it fixed.  The associate at the counter was not friendly at all when dealing with it, so I asked for a refund.  The manager did come out and give me a refund and was nice.  He asked this associate to make sure I got my sandwich - as soon as he walked away she told me to just go around the corner and pick it up.  Apparently they took my food up front, because another associate came back around and gave it to me.  This time I checked and noticed there was no bacon on it (it was a Bravo Bacon Turkey sandwich), so I go back up to the counter.  This time the associate was nice and even joked around with me about the bacon being the best part.  When I go around to the pick up window one of the girls in the back was arguing with the expo guy saying she did the sandwich right.  If it hadn't been for me saying that it was missing bacon I don't know what they would have done.  This time I took my sandwich and went back to the office because my lunch hour was almost over by now.  When I get to the office, now the sandwich is missing the turkey and there are no chips in the bag.  I called and spoke with the manager who was apologetic and said he would be calling me back within a couple of hours and wanted to get more info at that time so he could get me a gift card.  Never heard back from the manager.  What this boils down to here is I understand we are all human and make mistakes, but for the most part the employees lacked basic customer service skills and had poor attitudes, which made me more upset than the sandwich being wrong.  A smile and saying you're sorry goes a long way.  Have never had this experience at a Panera before, but it was rough."

This location (as well as the location in CMC/Levine hospital down the street) apparently are needing some training as well as system updates, maybe? I placed an order online for rapid pick-up. It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told \"We're out of that souffle. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.\" I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese souffle so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund. This is the SECOND time I've had an issue with this location. I won't return but I suggest you fix it soon, Panera"
