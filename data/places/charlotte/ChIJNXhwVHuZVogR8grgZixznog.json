So we sat empty handed to wait.\n\nNoticed that the light over our table had no bulb, but a stick on LED that didn't work.\n\nMy pick 2 included a hot Mexican corn soup with plenty of potatoes and corn, but zero seasoning. The Greek salad has nice crispy lettuce and a good amount of feta, but only 2 sad little olives. And 3 thin, depressing strips of chicken.\n\nSo the food was ok, but certainly not worth $16 (including drink)"

The next thing I noticed is that the bacon was missing on one of the half sandwich I ordered, I needed to ask for a remake. The croissant came out cold and isn't worth paying $3 for. This reminded me of how nasty the coffee at Panera is and am not coming back."

It started out with me making an online delivery order for me & my kids because I just had surgery & was on bed rest. Well the wait was an hour & a 1/2 which we waited. I then received an email notification saying your food has been delivered. Checked my front door no food! I even had my daughter go check my neighbors front doors no food! So I called & got in touch with the manager this guy is the definition of what a manager should be! At first he had trouble finding my order that I placed which made me a little frustrated at first because the charge had already been debited from my card. So the manager says no worries I'll fix this, so he finds my order apologizes for the non delivery order & advises me that the next available time for delivery is another 2 hours away but to avoid me having to wait another 2 hours he will personally bring it out to me himself! Holy cow! I thought excellent customer service like this no longer exist! He brings it out knocks on the door & personally hands me our food! & The food was still smoking hot almost burned my tongue on the soup! & He wouldn't even except a tip! Only thing I regret is that I didn't get his name! Great deeds like this shouldn't go unnoticed!"

They also forgot to give me my coffee I also ordered!!!!! After I left in a bad mood I realize that they didn't even give me butter and made my order wrong!!!
