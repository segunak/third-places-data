This combined with coming at 7am and having to wait for the staff member to finish setting up (again, I didn\u2019t have a lot of time to wait as I was traveling), just didn\u2019t make for a good experience.",

I tried giving this place a chance but I like my coffee strong. Well, I drink lattes or white mochas mostly.. a 20 oz should have 4 shots espresso..3 minimum. Not sure how many shots are in their drinks but I sure couldn't taste it.. my white mocha tasted like chocolate milk. If coffee was stronger or if they put more espresso shots without charging.. it's high enough as is.I'd probably like it alot more. But if you prefer not to taste the coffee then you will like it! Staff was nice. Also, No drive thru is a negative in my book.",

We rarely buy coffee except what we buy at the grocery store to make at home.  One medium and one small pumpkin spice latte total was over $14.00.  I did a double take when he said the total.  To top it off we don\u2019t taste the pumpkin spice at all. The girl making the drink turned to her co-worker and said the pump is weird about the syrup dispenser and he shrugged it off.  My wife thought of getting a desert but looking inside the case she said she saw like little fruit flies or something flying around.  The two baristas did not bring us our drink or wait on us.  We were the only customers in line, but in the check out person asked us if we wanted to leave a tip which you can self select (they don\u2019t have to ask) but ok they wanted to put us on the spot.  Is there not enough margin in a  $7 latte that also the employees are asking for a tip for doing nothing but standing there?  This is China Grove not Huntersville.  We live here to get away from that lifestyle to a simpler more wholesome place.   Is this a business (clearly at that price) or a charity - I buy my whole canister of coffee for to use in my coffee machine for $6.99 but they still ask for a tip when you can do it yourself at their little iPad.  So in conclusion a latte in general  is an overpriced extravagance to begin with.  A badly mad latte that is overpriced *even for a latte* is reason enough to never go back.",

We are trying to shine the light and love of Jesus Christ in a world that is so broken, dark and hurting and you would prefer us to be more quiet about that? We think that goes against everything Jesus stands for. \n\nWe are not a Christian \"based\" coffee shop, we ARE a Christian coffee shop. If someone singing about their encounter with Jesus offends you, that's OK. That's your preference, but not something you can force on others. We stand by our openess and unashamed desire to spread the love of Jesus to a lost and dying world. It's not a ploy or anything of the like. \n\nWe serve great coffee and good food (as you stated) but we are a ministry first and foremost. ",

The young lady took our order fairly quickly, but it wasn't apparent immediately that there were at least 4-5 orders ahead of us. After waiting 20 minutes to receive our complete order (2 drinks & 2 scones), I took a bite of what was the worst scone I have ever had in my life. It was dry and stale and should not have been sold to me. My breve was mediocre at best.\nAnother notable mention is the fact that the Manager or Owner was in the shop meeting with some other gentlemen. It was quite clear that this young lady was overwhelmed and VERY slow and he did not offer to help her fulfill the orders to ensure everyone was served in a reasonable amount of time.\n20 minutes is too long to wait for good coffee and food let alone poor-quality ones. There are many other great coffee shops in the area, so I won't be returning here.",

We are thankful for our patrons and those who choose to support us because of what we stand for and because we are small business.\n\nIf you ever give us another try, it's all on us. Please understand we are not okay with the service you received.  \n\nWe do get some of our pastries from a local baker, and are usually selling out of everything before they can bring more, so this must've been an abnormal occurrence. They're always delicious when fresh. \n\nLastly, because others will be reading this I want future customers to be aware, that our manager was in a very important meeting at the time of your encounter. The baristas are aware that they may get a rush of people and will be required to make the drinks alone because a manager may not always be available. To be noted, though, our managers DO NOT leave our baristas high and dry. Once the meeting was completed he went back to help out. \n\nRushes happen and waiting for coffee is a normal occurrence at any establishment, but waiting for mediocre coffee is definitely not a win for anyone. This we are sorry for and would love to offer you a free one in its place. \n\nIf you're ever again in the area and need a quick pick me up, please stop in and we will make it right. ",

We have frequently stopped by here in the past but stopped as the service was never friendly and yesterday we thought after a year we would try it again. Sadly it hasn\u2019t changed. When we got there the man at the register was very kind and so was the young girl making our drinks. But out of no where another woman steps behind the counter (I assume a manger to help with training) and is just beyond rude and belittling to the employee that took our order that was helping the barista make drinks. So much so that it made me very uncomfortable to even watch.She was so rude and disrespectful I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone would let an employee talk like that to anyone especially with a customer standing right there.I was a manger at a coffee shop for over 3 years and never would I have allowed a situation like that to happen. Totally unprofessional. We spent over $20 for this experience and yes the coffee was great but this whole encounter made me feel so uncomfortable and regretted ever coming back to give this place another chance. We didn\u2019t even stay to drink our coffee and left promptly . You can have a cute and relaxing decorated atmosphere for a coffee shop but if your employees aren\u2019t friendly and kind then what\u2019s the point? It doesn\u2019t make it that people will want to stay or even come back if the customer service is terrible. I\u2019m sorry but I can go to Starbucks or French express for a better experience where employees are friendly and kind. Will definitely not be coming back after that experience. Please do better with your customer service.",

Remember that reviews don't just affect the person you're reviewing...it affects the whole company and the people who really are working at their best to make your experience a memorable one. \n\nWhomever it was that offended you in such a way is most likely no longer employed with us. We have recently gone through many changes and God has shown us areas of improvement and we have acted on it. \n\nA 1 star review, especially since your coffee was tasty seems a little harsh to us, but I hope you can give us another chance to show you who we really are. If you visit us again, ask for a manager and make sure your coffee is made to your liking and take a few moments to sit and relax. It's one of the best things about a local coffee shop. \ud83d\ude42",

It\u2019s sad to see such a cute little place fall off because of success. However, I will gladly take my hard earned money to French Express up the road.",

Their selection of drinks is not only diverse, but rather affordable at that. Even having a couple specialty house drinks as well! Can't recommend the Water to Wine enough! And just being off the main street here, makes it very accessible and easy to find!\n\nThey've been here for about 5 years and it's not hard to figure out why, as the store has quite the cozy atmosphere, with plenty of seating and soft lighting. A perfect place to bring friends and talk over some delicious coffee!\n\nFor the introverts of us (like myself), it's got plenty of books available to read, plenty of tables to take a sketchpad to and write or draw. As well as lots of outlets for chargers, for those who need to recharge their laptops and phones as much as their mental and spiritual batteries.\n\nI'd have taken pictures of my order, but I admittedly scarfed down my Red Velvet Muffin before I thought about writing a review. So you'll just have to take my word for it that their baked goods are not only beautiful, but delicious.\n\nIt's very clear from the get go, that their faith in their customer service and craft is as strong as their faith in the lord. And I certainly will be making a return here!",

Never said have a good day or anything. And I will repeat Christian coffee shop didn't offer to lift a finger and only tiped 6 dollars. Instacart shoppers beware. And to the people who support this shop please don't. The name Holy grind is just a cover up. No Holy people in there. And they took the little 6 dollar tip off after delivery. What a shame..

I let the lady at the counter know right away that this was our first time and was hoping for suggestions, but got nothing. I told the cashier that I normally go with a chai latte but wanted something different, then before I knew it, they had already starting making the chai latte. And then they gave me oat milk when I asked for almond milk, twice. Also, the pastries are from Sam\u2019s Club and I would love to support local businesses that support other small businesses. But the cinnamon roll was legit. \ud83d\ude0b\nWhat I did love was the decor. Beautiful, contemporary yet cozy, just cool.\nAgain, I wanted to love this coffee place SO much, but my husband and I both felt the service was cold and it didn\u2019t give us that warm and cozy feeling that we feel going into local places like Local Patriots. I hope your experience is better. Happy eating! \ud83c\udf3a",

I'm sorry you didn't receive the greeting you had hoped for, because that isn't our heart here at THG. We would love for you to consider that maybe this was a new barista who was still nervous to share their opinion for fear of being wrong, or maybe they didn't hear you. Either way, we hire our baristas to have a heart for people and occasionally they have an off day. We still stand behind them \ud83e\udd0e\nAlso, the milks that aren't lactose typically look the exact same in the containers. So, if you did see a container that looked like it was almond, but was most likely oat. Our baristas know not to replace milk without consent. \nTo address your pastry issue, we use to have an on-site baker who's business we supported whole heartedly, but she has since moved on and we get our pastries from the most consistent place we can find locally that's within a customer's budget nowadays: Sam's Club. We love their pastries and think they're delicious. We would love to find someone local to support, and we DO in other areas i.e. cake pops and cookies are all sourced small business locally, but if you find someone please send them our way! \ud83d\ude42\n\nHope to see you soon!!",

I sat out doors but they have a very nice indoor area too.\n\nGreat place for a short break to have a cup of coffee and conversation.

Good prices great beverages. Best of all, the presence of God when you walk in is just awe inspiring. Beautiful architecture, cozy and warm feel, very welcoming, and Josh the manager is a great guy. You can go in and lounge inside or on the covered patio. I plan to spend much time here. May Gods blessing and favor be a never ending outpouring upon this establishment.",

I ordered a white mocha with raspberry, but the drink was made with blue raspberry instead, which did not pair well with coffee at all. I would have appreciated being asked or notified beforehand, as it completely changed the flavor in an unpleasant way.\n\nAdditionally, while waiting, I overheard a staff member making negative comments about customers who use delivery services like DoorDash \u2014 something I personally do often. It felt unwelcoming and unprofessional, especially considering that every order, big or small, supports the business.\n\nI usually try to support local coffee shops, but after this visit, I left feeling unwelcome and disappointed.",

I was in a hurry so I didn\u2019t check the muffin box before I left, when I got on the road I realized it was a chocolate muffin and I HATE chocolate muffins :( such a bummer because my order was over $13 for half of it going in the trash- I didn\u2019t have time to stop anywhere else or turn around to get the correct food item. This combined with coming at 7am and having to wait for the staff member to finish setting up (again, I didn\u2019t have a lot of time to wait as I was traveling), just didn\u2019t make for a good experience.",

Not sure how many shots are in their drinks but I sure couldn't taste it.. my white mocha tasted like chocolate milk. If coffee was stronger or if they put more espresso shots without charging.. it's high enough as is.I'd probably like it alot more. But if you prefer not to taste the coffee then you will like it!

We rarely buy coffee except what we buy at the grocery store to make at home.  One medium and one small pumpkin spice latte total was over $14.00.  I did a double take when he said the total.  To top it off we don\u2019t taste the pumpkin spice at all. The girl making the drink turned to her co-worker and said the pump is weird about the syrup dispenser and he shrugged it off.  My wife thought of getting a desert but looking inside the case she said she saw like little fruit flies or something flying around.  The two baristas did not bring us our drink or wait on us.  We were the only customers in line, but in the check out person asked us if we wanted to leave a tip which you can self select (they don\u2019t have to ask) but ok they wanted to put us on the spot.  Is there not enough margin in a  $7 latte that also the employees are asking for a tip for doing nothing but standing there?  This is China Grove not Huntersville.  We live here to get away from that lifestyle to a simpler more wholesome place.   Is this a business (clearly at that price) or a charity - I buy my whole canister of coffee for to use in my coffee machine for $6.99 but they still ask for a tip when you can do it yourself at their little iPad.  So in conclusion a latte in general  is an overpriced extravagance to begin with.  A badly mad latte that is overpriced *even for a latte* is reason enough to never go back.",

When I objected, I was told that's how they make lattes (despite the fact that a latte is definitely made with espresso and steamed milk).

If someone singing about their encounter with Jesus offends you, that's OK. That's your preference, but not something you can force on others. We stand by our openess and unashamed desire to spread the love of Jesus to a lost and dying world.

After waiting 20 minutes to receive our complete order (2 drinks & 2 scones), I took a bite of what was the worst scone I have ever had in my life. It was dry and stale and should not have been sold to me. My breve was mediocre at best.\nAnother notable mention is the fact that the Manager or Owner was in the shop meeting with some other gentlemen. It was quite clear that this young lady was overwhelmed and VERY slow and he did not offer to help her fulfill the orders to ensure everyone was served in a reasonable amount of time.\n20 minutes is too long to wait for good coffee and food let alone poor-quality ones. There are many other great coffee shops in the area, so I won't be returning here.",

We are thankful for our patrons and those who choose to support us because of what we stand for and because we are small business.\n\nIf you ever give us another try, it's all on us. Please understand we are not okay with the service you received.  \n\nWe do get some of our pastries from a local baker, and are usually selling out of everything before they can bring more, so this must've been an abnormal occurrence. They're always delicious when fresh. \n\nLastly, because others will be reading this I want future customers to be aware, that our manager was in a very important meeting at the time of your encounter. The baristas are aware that they may get a rush of people and will be required to make the drinks alone because a manager may not always be available. To be noted, though, our managers DO NOT leave our baristas high and dry. Once the meeting was completed he went back to help out. \n\nRushes happen and waiting for coffee is a normal occurrence at any establishment, but waiting for mediocre coffee is definitely not a win for anyone. This we are sorry for and would love to offer you a free one in its place. \n\nIf you're ever again in the area and need a quick pick me up, please stop in and we will make it right. ",

We have frequently stopped by here in the past but stopped as the service was never friendly and yesterday we thought after a year we would try it again. Sadly it hasn\u2019t changed. When we got there the man at the register was very kind and so was the young girl making our drinks. But out of no where another woman steps behind the counter (I assume a manger to help with training) and is just beyond rude and belittling to the employee that took our order that was helping the barista make drinks. So much so that it made me very uncomfortable to even watch.She was so rude and disrespectful I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone would let an employee talk like that to anyone especially with a customer standing right there.I was a manger at a coffee shop for over 3 years and never would I have allowed a situation like that to happen. Totally unprofessional. We spent over $20 for this experience and yes the coffee was great but this whole encounter made me feel so uncomfortable and regretted ever coming back to give this place another chance. We didn\u2019t even stay to drink our coffee and left promptly . You can have a cute and relaxing decorated atmosphere for a coffee shop but if your employees aren\u2019t friendly and kind then what\u2019s the point? It doesn\u2019t make it that people will want to stay or even come back if the customer service is terrible. I\u2019m sorry but I can go to Starbucks or French express for a better experience where employees are friendly and kind. Will definitely not be coming back after that experience. Please do better with your customer service.",

Remember that reviews don't just affect the person you're reviewing...it affects the whole company and the people who really are working at their best to make your experience a memorable one. \n\nWhomever it was that offended you in such a way is most likely no longer employed with us. We have recently gone through many changes and God has shown us areas of improvement and we have acted on it. \n\nA 1 star review, especially since your coffee was tasty seems a little harsh to us, but I hope you can give us another chance to show you who we really are. If you visit us again, ask for a manager and make sure your coffee is made to your liking and take a few moments to sit and relax. It's one of the best things about a local coffee shop. \ud83d\ude42",

Their selection of drinks is not only diverse, but rather affordable at that. Even having a couple specialty house drinks as well! Can't recommend the Water to Wine enough! And just being off the main street here, makes it very accessible and easy to find!\n\nThey've been here for about 5 years and it's not hard to figure out why, as the store has quite the cozy atmosphere, with plenty of seating and soft lighting. A perfect place to bring friends and talk over some delicious coffee!\n\nFor the introverts of us (like myself), it's got plenty of books available to read, plenty of tables to take a sketchpad to and write or draw. As well as lots of outlets for chargers, for those who need to recharge their laptops and phones as much as their mental and spiritual batteries.\n\nI'd have taken pictures of my order, but I admittedly scarfed down my Red Velvet Muffin before I thought about writing a review. So you'll just have to take my word for it that their baked goods are not only beautiful, but delicious.\n\nIt's very clear from the get go, that their faith in their customer service and craft is as strong as their faith in the lord. And I certainly will be making a return here!",

I got to this so called Christian coffee shop and two men working behind counter not once offered to help get their stuff out of my car. After 4 trips in and out they just ist sat there talking.  Never said have a good day or anything. And I will repeat Christian coffee shop didn't offer to lift a finger and only tiped 6 dollars. Instacart shoppers beware. And to the people who support this shop please don't. The name Holy grind is just a cover up. No Holy people in there. And they took the little 6 dollar tip off after delivery. What a shame.. I believe if im not mistaken the person who placed order was Joshua.",

I let the lady at the counter know right away that this was our first time and was hoping for suggestions, but got nothing. I told the cashier that I normally go with a chai latte but wanted something different, then before I knew it, they had already starting making the chai latte. And then they gave me oat milk when I asked for almond milk, twice. Also, the pastries are from Sam\u2019s Club and I would love to support local businesses that support other small businesses. But the cinnamon roll was legit. \ud83d\ude0b\nWhat I did love was the decor. Beautiful, contemporary yet cozy, just cool.\nAgain, I wanted to love this coffee place SO much, but my husband and I both felt the service was cold and it didn\u2019t give us that warm and cozy feeling that we feel going into local places like Local Patriots. I hope your experience is better. Happy eating! \ud83c\udf3a",

I'm sorry you didn't receive the greeting you had hoped for, because that isn't our heart here at THG. We would love for you to consider that maybe this was a new barista who was still nervous to share their opinion for fear of being wrong, or maybe they didn't hear you. Either way, we hire our baristas to have a heart for people and occasionally they have an off day. We still stand behind them \ud83e\udd0e\nAlso, the milks that aren't lactose typically look the exact same in the containers. So, if you did see a container that looked like it was almond, but was most likely oat. Our baristas know not to replace milk without consent. \nTo address your pastry issue, we use to have an on-site baker who's business we supported whole heartedly, but she has since moved on and we get our pastries from the most consistent place we can find locally that's within a customer's budget nowadays: Sam's Club. We love their pastries and think they're delicious. We would love to find someone local to support, and we DO in other areas i.e. cake pops and cookies are all sourced small business locally, but if you find someone please send them our way! \ud83d\ude42\n\nHope to see you soon!!",

Good prices great beverages. Best of all, the presence of God when you walk in is just awe inspiring. Beautiful architecture, cozy and warm feel, very welcoming, and Josh the manager is a great guy. You can go in and lounge inside or on the covered patio. I plan to spend much time here. May Gods blessing and favor be a never ending outpouring upon this establishment.",
