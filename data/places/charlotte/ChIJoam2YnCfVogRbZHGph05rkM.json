She was rude, short and the coffee she made tasted terrible. I was bright and good vibes since I know Mondays can be a little gloomy. I walked in and stood at the lunch/dinner counter because I didn't realize the coffee was over to the left since it was my first time going for coffee. Off jump, she was rude pointing to where the coffee was and immediately said she only had drip coffee, which is totally fine. That's all I wanted. But the attitude she had for the rest of the transaction really rubbed me the wrong way. I will try again if she is not working."

Once you understand that, it's super easy to get to, especially on foot or you can take the train. It's between East/West and the soon to be built Southline station.\n\nSycamore is fancy. Lots of exposed wood, great lighting and tables all about. Expect it to be full of local young professionals drinking and enjoying nibbles. The pizza looked great and they have burgers too."

After making our way to the rooftop and taking a seat, we were told to make our way downstairs as they were closing. We sat on the ground level inside and were then told to make our way outside shortly after sitting as they were closing. We sat on the patio and were then decided we were going to make our way to the next bar that was open later on a Saturday night. As we were leaving, we decided to take a picture with the lantern lights behind us but were then harassed by 2 bouncers that we needed to leave immediately, mind you as we were literally walking towards the exit. We asked if we could take 5 seconds to take a quick picture to which we were told \"you had the last 10 minutes to take a picture, I have somewhere to be\" to which I replied it would take literally 10 seconds. We were then stared at while taking a quick picture and then we continued on to somewhere that actually stays open till a decent hour on a Saturday night in a city, QC Pourhouse, so shout out to them! Much better service/atmosphere. Absolutely rude and unnecessary attitude from the bouncers as we were on the PATIO where any other people were lingering. Will NOT be returning here and I hope they find different well mannered bouncers."

I felt safe, there was also a security attendant sitting in the foyer of the building. Decor is high end and elegant, seating is plentiful, the bar area was kept very clean by employees.

We waited in line for 10-15 minutes(pretty normal) and two of the girls I was with got their drinks. Then my friend and I handed her our ID and cards and she just told us \"no\". She said she refused to serve us and when we asked why she said it was because we had fake IDs. We told her they were real and that we just moved here and she was just straight up rude to us and told us we needed to go to the cop down stairs. Even the strangers around us were like \"No way she just actually denied y'all that was crazy\". She caused a scene and was so mean to us. We then went downstairs (there were no cops) and had to wait in line again to get a drink and this time the bartender was so sweet. The group I was with couldn't believe the way she treated us."

My friend tried to move the heater, which led the employee to come up behind, put him in a chokehold, and attempt bringing him to the ground. Should my friend have asked to move the heater? Of course. However, at no point should an employee in the customer service industry lay their hands on a customer, unless they are trying to deescalate a situation. What I assumed to be management came after and when I tried to explain the situation, they decided to kick us all out. This all felt very thuggish and I had to debate calling the police. I'm leaving this review to hopefully get some sort of corrective action from management. At no point should an establishment condone violent escalation."

It was not busy at all. The woman behind the bar completely ignored us for about 5 minutes and continued to chat away with 2 other customers who already had their beers, so she wasn't talking about their beer or what they should order. Finally, another woman came around the corner from the other side of the bar, where I think she was attending to a private party. She offered to help us and the first woman finally acknowledged us and took our order. After we had our beers, we noticed some beer on display and wanted to buy a 4-pack of them. The same server said they didn't have any of that beer at the bar and sent us to the other end of their space. That guy said they didn't have any but there might be some in the mini-fridges behind the bar. Went back to the bar and she couldn't find any but 2 other workers dug through the fridge and found 4 singles of that beer. SMH"

While some may miss the cosy vibe, the new atmosphere provides a nice energy, plenty of places to sit, and various areas to explore.\n\nThe beer selection was pretty on par what you'd expect, plenty of choices. I'd recommend the Vanilla Southern Girl.\n\nI'm knocking off a star because the food was nothing to write home about. If you need some incredibly average, over priced bar food, you'll be happy. Otherwise, eat before you come.\n\nOverall, would go back. But would eat first."

For lunch, I had the roast beef sandwich that I really enjoyed.  My date had a pizza, and she let me try a slice.  The food was delicious.  Sycamore is a brewery that is one of the best in Charlotte, and I highly recommend visiting."

The atmosphere was great, however the bartender that tried to take mine & my friends (real) IDs ruined the experience for us. When I asked why she would be keeping mine she stated, with a terrible attitude, that it was fake. After arguing with her, she took both of our IDs again and then comes back to say it was actually my friends that was fake and that she'd be keeping it. She eventually got a manager and the situation was resolved and we were both served, but the way she handled this interaction was extremely distasteful. If she had concerns about the legitimacy of our IDs then fine, but she was rude & couldn't even remember which ID she was so confident was fake. Also, bartenders have no authority to confiscate IDs so I should have never had to argue to get mine back. All in all, I just hope they provide staff some training on checking IDs & how to properly handle these situations."

And just bc you no longer drink alcohol doesn't mean you don't still love the taste of beer!\nI would also challenge you to be the first brewery in our area to brew a NA beer!\nI am and always will be a huge fan of Sycamore and have enjoyed watching your success!!

My issue is the only place to get a drink is inside, no outside bar. I went in to get a drink and was promptly told I could not have my dog inside. I asked where do I get a drink and was told I had to wait for an outside bar to open. I asked when will it be opened and was told \"I don't know\". Needless to say I will not be back"

With this many beers on tap this is a major disappointment.  3.  The indoor space is too loud. There isn't anything soft inside the taproom. This causes the entire indoor area to be difficult to talk with the person beside you.\nOne thing Sycamore did correctly: not allowing dogs inside or upstairs."

However, a recent change in their policy has left a sour taste in the mouths of many loyal patrons. The decision to prohibit dogs upstairs on their outdoor balcony or inside the premises has undoubtedly altered the once-welcoming atmosphere of this popular establishment.\n\nOne of the main draws of Sycamore was its dog-friendly environment, which created a unique and inclusive atmosphere. The outdoor balcony provides the perfect setting for dog owners to relax, savor their meals, and bond with their four-legged friends. Sadly, this cherished feature has been abruptly stripped away, leaving dog owners feeling unwelcome and excluded.\n\nThe rationale behind this decision remains unclear. While it is essential to maintain a clean and hygienic space for all customers, there are numerous ways to achieve this without resorting to such drastic measures.w By completely banning dogs from the upper floor and indoor areas, Sycamore has alienated a significant portion of their customer base.\n\nMoreover, the absence of dogs in the venue has led to a noticeable decline in the vibrant and lively ambiance that Sycamore was once known for. The joyous barks, wagging tails, and friendly interactions between dogs served as a heartwarming backdrop that made dining at Sycamore a truly unique experience. The lack of this vibrant energy has transformed the once-bustling venue into a more sterile and less inviting space.\n\nWhile it is understandable that Sycamore may have encountered challenges or received complaints related to dogs in their premises, it is essential to remember that dogs are cherished members of many families. By banning them from 2/3 of the venue, the restaurant has alienated not only the dog owners but also the general community that enjoyed the presence of these furry companions.\n\nUltimately, Sycamore's decision to disallow dogs upstairs on their outdoor balcony or inside the venue is disappointing and has resulted in a noticeable decline in its overall charm. While cleanliness and customer satisfaction are undoubtedly important, there are alternative solutions that could have been explored to address any concerns without eliminating the dog-friendly atmosphere. Hopefully, Sycamore will reconsider this policy and restore its former appeal as a welcoming and inclusive establishment for both two-legged and four-legged visitors alike."

The vibe is great, the outside seating area is spacious and cute, they're dog friendly and offer lots of different drink options.  My issue is I went for the very first time and did not have a great first experience.  The bartender was pretty snotty, yes it was busy but there were maybe 5 people in line at the time I was ordering and there were 3 bartenders behind the bar.  Since I had never been I had no clue what they offered, how the beers taste etc.  The names are listed on the board but no description of what each one is and the bartender was \"far too busy\" to assist.  I asked for ONE sample and she said \"Oh we don't do samples\"  I told her it was my first time there and wanted to know how to find out which one I like and she \"I guess you don't.\"  I ordered my husband's beer, which I did not like and we listened to the band while he drank.  My husband then went an ordered me a frozen paloma for a whopping $10 and it was disgusting.  Did not taste like a paloma at all!  I would try again but if I get the same \"awesome\" service I won't be back, there are plenty of other places in the area that are eager to please."
