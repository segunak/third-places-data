He was just standing there looking at us when we walked up to the counter. I had to speak to him first, and he still didn't even say anything. So I just went ahead and told him what i wanted. After I ordered my coffee, we ended up standing to the side of the register just in case someone came in to order too. After he made my drink, he put my drink on the other side of the counter where people would usually pick up their drinks when their names were called if it was super busy. And he didn't even say anything. I was talking to my daughter during that time and didn't even realized he was finished with my drink then I finally made eye contact with him 2 minutes later, and he said oh your drink is over there and pointed where it was at. So I had to walk all the way to the other side to get my drink. I was so upset cause he could've just handed the drink to me cause we were the only ones there. No customers anywhere. I'm not sure if he did that because of my race, but he made me feel that way. I wouldn't be going back to this Starbucks. I'll take my money somewhere else since my daughter and my present were so disgusting to him to the point where he didn't want to serve us."

On May 18, 2024, I used the mobile app to make my usual order a Royal English Breakfast Tea with splash of oat milk and 5 packs of Splenda.\n\nAfter picking up my order, it was clearly wrong, which is an issue I've had about 5 times in the past few weeks to inform the manager of this issue. When I spoke to the manager Mathew about my issue he offered a free drink, which I politely declined and let him know my goal of the call was to let him know what could be done to have my tea made correctly through mobile ordering, because once I pick up my order I need to get to work on time, so it would be helpful for my daily routine. Matthew negatively responded and told me if his location keeps messing up my drink every time or every other time I should go to another location \" he said I wouldn't come here I'd go somewhere else\" where they don't mess up my drink, (how does that resolve the issue. either i'm being targeted bc it's a mobile order same name same order or your messing everyone's drink up and they not complaining) he went on to say I have an excellent staff and I'm watching them make my drinks. Sounds like to me neither Matthew or his staff do not have any attention to detail as there's no oat milk or sugar in my drink like the label says so. Clearly In the picture. I understand that mistakes happen and I am a very patient person, but this is not the type of customer service response that is effective or appreciated from a global public company.\n\nClearly are pics below and the orders I've placed."

They don't have a pastry/food display. If I don't see it, ai won't buy it. Can't believe they don't have one. They took the bar away with all the spices and basic extras we need for mixing drinks. Adding cinnamon, and honey. She offered a honey \"flavored type syrup\" out of the flavor pumps. A young 16-19 yr old, tried to tell me it was honey. She must not know what real honey is and that runny watery honey like that is mixed with water and sugar. Super disappointed. Not ever going in there just for fun anymore. The chain coffee shop changed so much in the past 10 yrs. Not worth my time or $. Would rather pay $2-3 less. Get better quality locally served, all quality ingredients coffee and tea and have fresh pastries. People just pay for the space to hang out basically and up-charged regular drinks. Im from Seattle, can't believe this is what Starbucks turned into 15 years later. Very disappointed.\nThe only reason you're getting good business there is because you're monopolizing the coffee shop industry and opened a shop in a new middle/upper class area with no other small coffee shops around. Oh wait, there's another Starbucks across the street inside the grocery store. Very unfortunate!"

I ask for it to be made a specific way but it's not like rocket science, it's a venti cup filled half way up with a tall white chocolate mocha and the other half with whip and a ton of caramel crunch topping which I get charged a little extra for. I have no problem paying whatever extra amount they think is appropriate for the extra crunch topping. Anyway, I've had to send my drink back several times to be remade correctly and I'll hear different members of the staff talking smack about me because I want my drink made right. I'm sorry but if I'm spending that kind of money somewhere I expect to get what I am paying for. So because I expect my drink and food to be made right and return it when it's not and because I have gotten frustrated when I've heard the staff making rude comments about me I have basically been told I'm not welcome there. Keep in mind when my drink is right I tip 2, 5, and sometimes even 10 dollars. I'm just saying, don't expect your money or loyalty to matter at this particular location."

Now we've gotten these drinks several times in the past, and we know how they're supposed to taste. The word disgusting does not quite fit.

I sat in the drive through line for over 15 min. I could see people walking in and out during the time I was just sitting there.  I couldn't back up because there were cars behind me.   When I finally got to the window I asked the lady what happened and she said they'd had lots of issues and that's why it took so long.  considering that people use the drive through so that it's quick...when you know your drive through is not moving perhaps it would be helpful to send someone out to alert customers.  Or even better, just make the coffee free for the people that were waiting over 15 min.  For the approx $5/customer it might have cost them it would have generated immense goodwill.  I know I will not be stopping at this Starbucks any more on my way to work."

I've been here three times so far, and each time the staff has ignored me when I've walked up to the counter. Then today, my drink was made wrong and when I said something about it, they first questioned the order and then asked \"do you want me to try to fix it?\" Um, well, id really love if you would remake it, but yes, I at least need you to fix it since that's why I waited in line to talk to you about it. With a Starbucks on every corner, I'm not sure how some more experienced staff couldn't have been brought in to make this Starbucks really great."
