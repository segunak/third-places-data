The staff is great and the music is not bad either. No DJ just house music. Seems to be okay parking in the lot and even a bike rack which is my form of transportation today. I have to come back and try the food to give you all a real review. So far it's a thumbs up for me. Let's rate it!\n0-10\n\nThis place today is a 6 out of 10\n\nCustomer service is good here but I need to try the food right! I'll be back again soon!!!!"

Just to see the exact same sandwich still on the menu to get back in a long line just to order. I placed an order to go over phone, said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Showed up in 10 expected to wait 5-15 more. Waited 35 minutes for one meatless wrap. 50 total minutes to make a wrap on a slow day. My final straw was when I went in to order, sat at the counter for a solid 5 minutes looking around for someone to take order but nobody was there, finally see a dude walk up to a lady sitting down to ask her something, she walks him over to the counter, literally told me to scoot over so she could take his order. Ridiculous. Stop hiring people because they look the part, your staff is useless"

The guy behind the counter was rude and brought what I ordered out on a plate when I told him I wanted it to go. He then huffed and puffed, and wrapped it up to go. I've never had such awful service here. I'm a local to the neighborhood and I'll travel to other common markets around town to avoid the awful and rude service here. What a shame."

They even have sandwiches  and other foods on their menu. Nice  place to socialize and have a beer or two as well. It definitely gets a thumbs-up from me."

As of early May 2017 they are still working on stocking the store since they JUST opened and I look forward to their expanded offerings and prepared meals. Apparently they will have a fresh juice bar and will also have cold brew coffee soon so their offerings will be quite comprehensive. They have a great indoor/outdoor patio that is covered and should work as a four season dining area. Thankfully it is non-smoking and has a couple outdoor fans. The Common Market \"Oakwold\" is a cool spot for a quick bite or a hangout where you can order beer on tap or grab your favorite craft beer or wine from the shelves and pop the cap and serve yourself. Glad Common Market chose Oakhurst for their newest location!! We are already regulars and love having them as neighbors."
