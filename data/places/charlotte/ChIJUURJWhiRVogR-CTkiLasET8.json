This is not safe if your giving tea to a kids or the elderly they can digest the loose tea particles and choke..  I think customers should be warned of this type of brewing process."

I brought my laptop as I had planned to stay and work. The shop was packed however, and the music was loud which isn't conducive for working. The middle bar/island seating barstools are weird. They swing in/out and it's very easy to lose your balance and slip as I did along with 2 other women who were sitting down across from me at the same time. The latte was underwhelming and was missing the rich espresso flavor I like. It tasted more like watered down coffee with flavored syrup and foam. I'm gonna stick to the Starbucks rivers and lakes I'm used to."

Disappointed local.\n\nInitial review:\nAmazing location with great, friendly workers. I've been waiting for a place to work and hang out locally for a long time and I think I've found my spot.
