The Huntersville location is closer so the Cornelius location is a bit out of the way but worth the drive. I don't like super sweet coffee (like some of the big franchises) and theirs was perfect! It's very nice in there as well, super laid back and any place with Anthony Bourdain and Jimi Hendrix on the wall are pretty cool in my book.\n\nAlso, they get 10 stars for service, everyone was nice and the young man that helped me made sure my coffee was to my liking and offered up front to remake it if it wasn't."

I have frequented Main Street Coffee in Huntersville for years, so it was nice to see this new location with the bakery. The shop is clean and very nice. As I perused the pastries everything looked so sweet and decadent. I purchase a sticky bun, a cinnamon roll, a chocolate chip cookie and an almond croissant. Everything was PERFECT. The cookie was full of chocolate. It was clearly great quality chocolate and the salt on top just enhanced the amazing flavor, while also keeping the sweetness perfect. The croissant was flakey and full of almond flavor. Again, not to sweet, but the perfect balance and the buttery flakiness I expect. I was really concerned that the sticky bun and cinnamon roll would be way too sweet. Let me just say that the bakers clearly know what they're doing. The sweetness was perfect and the flavor off the chart! They told me to put them in the microwave for 10 second, and it was like it had just come out of the oven. If you want fantastic pastries, or just a cookie and coffee I highly recommend stopping in. Great food, great coffee and fantastic service!"

While I understand that inflation has affected prices, this seems like blatant price gouging. Quality is below average too.\n\n3/5/2023 Replying to the owner: It seems evident that the owner cannot handle criticism and doesn't value their customers since they seem to prefer us going to Starbucks instead. I'm curious as to why there's an additional charge of $1.35 for oat milk. Did they craft it by hand in the back? Despite being new to Cornelius, the establishment already gives off negative vibes. I regret spending my money here and suggest that the arrogant owner takes their attitude elsewhere."

(Didn't even realize they had this) She wrote down our preferences and took down our phone# in case there were any issues, we asked for the total but was told to just pay when we came back later.\nCalled at 2 to let them know we'd be in at 3:30 to grab our order and was told by the NEW owner that they don't take orders that aren't pre-paid. Tried to discuss the previous conversation and was abruptly cut off and told that they had no order for us, they don't hold items without payment and that we would just have to get what was left in the case. She was huffing into the phone with frustration as I continued to explain that we had been loyal customers for quite some time prior to her taking over, and that we would have been more than happy to prepay when we were there that morning if we would have been told, additionally since they had our name and phone number, a call would have been appreciated so we could have taken care of payment right away even if over the phone. She definitely appears to have quite a large chip on her shoulder and seems to not have the ability to effectively communicate without getting angry, frustrated and defensive.

I just ate an (ok, fine, another) almond croissant......first thoughts.....if you were on death row this should be your last meal (well, this almond croissant and 9 or 10 other scrumptious treats from Bakery 28) so you would at least get to experience heaven once.  The light airy layers baked to perfection with awesome crunch and delectable flavor there are simply no words that do justice to the perfection which these almond croissants are made.  Trust me, if you eat one, and then decide next weekend you are going to get some more, it may be the only thing you can think about for a week.  And I double dare you to see one, pick it up and say you are just going to take a bite and save the rest for later.\n\nKeli goes above and beyond on customized orders (designing a birthday cake for a special occasion), consistently provides for your special requests/orders and the showcases are eye stopping.  Every stop in reminds me of the finest bakeries in Paris and Europe.\n\nROCK ON!!!  NOTE TO CUSTOMERS, per the website and I can attest to this---the croissants sell out.  Place an order the day ahead and it will be met!  Two neighbors in my condo complex will be in heaven shortly with the treats I'm bringing them from Bakery 28.\n\nSO GLAD to have such a high quality bakery in Cornelius NC!!!!\n\nTo everyone at Bakery 28 from finger puppet Steve--May your 2022 be filled with health, happiness, adventure, prosperity, and peace."

The mini treats were adorable and delicious! Keli pitched the idea to me to also decorate the treats with special fondant imagery. That idea had not occurred to me but ended up being my favorite part. I asked her to create fondant of movie imagery because my husband and I met at a movie rental store - and she nailed it! I got such a kick out of it. I asked the photographer to take pictures of the dessert table because I loved it so much. I took some of the desserts home for leftovers and days later, I still smiled at the fondant and enjoyed the treats. Keli gave me exactly the sweets table that I had envisioned. It was perfect and delicious. I recommend Bakery28 for weddings but also as a delicious bakery!"

First of all, it smells heavenly when you walk through the door. It was around 5:30 when we arrived, and according to Google they close at 6, but they were still obviously working in the kitchen because the smells were fresh. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and chic, and the cakes and desserts in the cases look absolutely astounding and irresistible. They have a large selection of vegan and gluten free options which my date was enthusiastic about. She ended up ordering a coconut gluten free cupcake, and I ordered one of the mini \"Girl Scout Peanut Butter\" cheesecakes (capped with part of a Girl Scout Tagalong, as well as a Key Lime tart. Both the cheesecake and the tart were scrumptious - absolutely devine. I sampled my date's cupcake and it was also delicious. Will plan to drop in again if we're ever back in Cornelius."

We also love to support a local and woman owned small business!\n\nThey carry traditional bakery items, higher caliber items such as domes and petit fours. They always have a selection of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options.\n\nFavorite items:\nALMOND TOFFEE (incredibly addictive and the perfect not too hard texture)\nCroissants (plan & almond)\nNapoleon\nCake balls (dangerously good!)\nCookie cake\nThe little domes and other little items in the refrigerated display\nCookie Yule Log\n\nThey have hands down the best croissants in town! Some days they sell out very early as it appears not to be a secret.\n\nWe have had a few specialty items made including a birthday cake for a relative that was a Swedish Princess cake. Even though it is not a listed option on their website Chef Keli was able to whip it up for us with a couple days notice. She even dyed the marzipan to the birthday gal's favorite color :)\n\nAt Christmas, we ordered a tray of cookies to give to a local vet's office. They totally knocked it out of the park the tray was a perfect mix of many different items they carry cookies, brownies, petite fours. The office we gave it to LOVED it. Chef Keli and her team even created super adorable dog puns to put on the tray. The vet's office employees were passing the box around to take down Bakery 28's info so they could use them in the future. It was a smash hit!\n\nEmployees are very helpful and friendly. The whole experience and shop is a very happy helpful place."

So I left and went to another bakery right around the corner (Sweet Cakes bakery). Where I was greeted right away and I got 12 amazing cupcakes and Cake pops.
