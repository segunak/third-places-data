They have lounging chairs or hightop tables, candles on some of the tables, and music playing in the background. Definitely nice to do some work, or meet up with friends."

The quality of my drink was exceptional and the service was impeccable.\n\nIndigo Coffee & Tea is located inside Alongside Brewing and the vibes are soothing. From the playlist and artwork to the furniture in the space and the lighting, this little coffee spot hidden near the heart of  Charlotte is a nice place to meet with friends, work solo, or just hide away.\n\nParking is limited to keep that in mind, however, it's worth the stop!"
